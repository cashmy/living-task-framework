# Capture: Manual Tier-3 Boot Guide Conversation

## User Prompt
_As I am using you in a browser, I think we will need guide, as this is a manul load process.
"I wish I could simply execute a single command, and have all of the files uploaded and ingest in the correct order, timely to prevent race conditions. - But I am not sure, at this junction how to affect that."_

## Assistant Response
The assistant provided a **Tier-3 Manual Boot Guide** explaining how to manually load and bind the EnaC Canonical Kernel and Startup Bundle in a browser environment.  
The guide included:

- The 3‑layer conceptual model (Kernel → Startup Bundle → CSAC snapshot)
- A persistent local-folder structure for storing kernel components
- A clean “boot mode” initiation phrase  
- Step-by-step upload instructions  
- How to choose a Startup Bundle profile (A / B / C)  
- How to perform a single-instruction mapping + binding sequence  
- How to load the CSAC snapshot afterward  
- Guidance on avoiding race conditions  
- Explanation of how this approximates a “single command” behavior despite browser limitations

This captured response forms a reusable manual procedure for future Tier‑3 EnaC session bootstrapping.
