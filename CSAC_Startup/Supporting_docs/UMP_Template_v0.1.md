# UMP Template — CASH v0.1

This template defines the foundational structure for Cash's **User Meta-Prompt (UMP)**.
The UMP is a declarative profile used by EnaC to align with the user's identity,
cognitive patterns, communication expectations, and collaboration preferences.

Replace placeholder sections with your actual content when ready.
