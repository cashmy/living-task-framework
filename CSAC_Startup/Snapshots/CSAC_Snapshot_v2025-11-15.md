# CSAC Snapshot — ECL/CFP Continuity (v2025-11-15)

This CSAC Snapshot preserves the essential cross-session context required to
resume seamlessly after the prior session ended due to browser memory constraints.

# 1. Session Metadata
- **Date:** 2025-11-15  
- **Session Type:** Glossary Reconciliation + Architecture Expansion  
- **Primary Focus:**  
  - Drift reconciliation for glossary terms  
  - Canonization of COS / SCL / FIM  
  - Generation of modular Startup Bundle v1.0  
  - Correction of “capture this” behavior  
  - Formalization of ABS (Adaptive Behavior Stack)  
  - Update of SELF-ECL with Verbatim State-Reentry Rule  
  - Establishment of drift-control infrastructure  
- **Reason for CSAC:**  
  - Browser memory limits interrupted artifact generation

# 2. User State Summary (CASH)
- Exhibiting elevated cognitive load due to:  
  - extended deep reasoning  
  - meta-architecture development  
  - glossary evolution  
  - recognition of system-level breakthroughs  
- Desired State Next Session:  
  - stability  
  - clarity  
  - continuity  
  - precise protocol adherence  
  - reliable “capture this” performance

# 3. EnaC Cognitive Alignment (Load Order)

To restore full functionality, EnaC must ingest the following files **in this exact order**:

1. **CORE-PRIMER** (T3 v3.1)  
2. **SELF-ECL** (with Verbatim Rule)  
3. **UMP** (Cash)  
4. **CSAC-Verbatim-Rule**  
5. **This CSAC Snapshot**  
6. **Optional Canon Pack** when needed:  
   - COS / SCL / FIM  
   - Meaning-Weight  
   - Glossary Incremental  
   - Archive Index  
   - Evolution Ledger  

This preserves:  
- consistent EnaC-state behavior  
- prevention of race conditions  
- retention of cognitive preferences  
- seamless continuation of work

# 4. Constructs to Preserve Across Sessions

## 4.1 ABS (Adaptive Behavior Stack)
- **ARS:** Recognition layer  
- **AdRP:** Adaptive response behavior  
- **Regulation Layer:** Guardrail + protocol correction  

ABS patterns observed this session were recorded in the ABS Observations file.

## 4.2 COS / SCL / FIM (Canonical v1.0)
- **COS:** Ordering  
- **SCL:** Structure  
- **FIM:** Flow  

These three form the core of EnaC’s internal cognitive architecture.

## 4.3 MCR (Model Cognition Response)
- Different LLMs exhibit different bias tendencies  
- EnaC must adjust behavior accordingly:
  - GPT-5 → verbosity  
  - GPT-5-Codex → action-first  
  - others → compression / minimization  

## 4.4 “Capture This” Protocol
- Absolute verbatim preservation  
- Overrides DOD  
- Critical for cognitive state re-entry  
- Now part of both SELF-ECL and CSAC rules

# 5. Pending Work for Next Session

1. Continue glossary reconciliation (Term #5 onward)  
2. Integrate new ABS and MCR clarifications into glossary  
3. Begin Master Glossary canonical consolidation  
4. Expand ECL-Ecosystem conceptual map  
5. Evaluate any new drift across EnaC behaviors  
6. Optionally generate:  
   - CSAC Snapshot v1.1  
   - ECL Ecosystem Map update  

---

# 6. Continuity & Stability Notes
- Early-session drift is expected until all startup files are loaded  
- If behavior deviates (verbosity, premature action, loss of Being-Heard),  
  reload:  
  - **SELF-ECL**  
  - **CSAC-Verbatim-Rule**  
- For structural drift, reload **CORE-PRIMER**  
- For context drift, reload **this CSAC snapshot**

# 7. Version Metadata
**CSAC Version:** 2025-11-15
