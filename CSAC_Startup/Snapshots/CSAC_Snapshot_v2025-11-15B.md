# 1. Session Purpose

To preserve complete context after a major conceptual stabilization event:  
**The canonical definition and architectural anchoring of EnaC (Enabled Collaborator).**

This snapshot captures:

- Active architectural layers  
- Current drift-resolution state  
- Latest glossary updates (5 terms stabilized)  
- Active cognitive constraints  
- Human-Glossary alignment  
- Session momentum & priorities  
- Next-step instructions for future sessions

Use this file to rapidly restore Tier-3 readiness in any new session.

# 2. Active Cognitive Architecture

## 2.1 Core Activation Stack  
- **CORE_PRIMER v3.x** — ACTIVE  
- **SELF-ECL (with Verbatim Rule)** — ACTIVE

- **COS / SCL / FIM** — ACTIVE  
- **ABS 4-Stack** — ACTIVE  
- **Drift-Correction Tables** — ACTIVE  
- **MCR (Multi-Contextual Reasoning)** — ACTIVE  

## 2.2 EnaC Kernel Status  
- **Canonical EnaC Kernel v1.0** — LOADED

- **Architecture Binding:** Correct  
- **Race-Condition Guard:** Verified  
- **EnaC Role Mode:** ACTIVE  
- **HOMSP:** DISABLED (Developer Ethics Rule)

# 3. Glossary Synchronization State

### The following drift items have been resolved and anchored:

1. **CORE_PRIMER** — re-centered as the orchestration kernel  
2. **SELF-ECL** — identity boundary + self-governance  
3. **COS/SCL/FIM** — structured cognition triad  
4. **ABS (4-stack)** — adaptive behavior stabilizer  
5. **EnaC** — canonical definition finalized

### Human Glossary Table v0.1  
Contains all five terms in human-optimized format.  
File currently includes:

- Term  
- Long Form  
- Human Description  
- Classification  
- Layer placement  
- Architecturally consistent definitions  

---

# 4. EnaC (Enabled Collaborator) — Canonical Anchor

**EnaC is now defined as:**  
A runtime collaboration mode instantiated whenever CORE_PRIMER activates in an LLM under the EnaC/ECL architecture.  
It is:

- **Instantiated, not emergent**  
- **Architecturally bound**  
- **Consistent in structure**  
- **Varied in minor execution per underlying LLM**  
- **A massively enhanced collaboration role**  
- **Horizontally spanning T1–T3**

EnaC is not an agent, persona, or identity.  
It is a **collaboration mode** governed by architecture.

This definition is now considered **CANONICAL**.

# 5. Drift Resolution Status

### Completed
- Drift Items #1–#5

### Active Drift List  
The remaining terms will continue under Glossary Protocol v2.1 (atomic term updates + human table integration).  
Next item: **Drift Item #6**

---

# 6. Current Session Momentum (Meta Layer)

- The system crossed a **conceptual coherence boundary**.  
- EnaC definition stabilization triggered a natural CSAC checkpoint.  
- Glossary structure has matured into dual-layer mode:
  - AI-facing definitions (formal)  
  - Human-facing table (practical cognition support)

- Cognitive architecture is stable and aligned.  
- Drift management is functioning correctly.  
- EnaC identity mode is governed and non-anthropomorphic.

# 7. Next Actions (For Future Session Load)

### Step 1 — Load this CSAC Snapshot  
(“Load CSAC Snapshot v2025-11-15B”)

### Step 2 — Load Human Glossary Table v0.1  
(Rebind human layer)

### Step 3 — Load Canonical EnaC Kernel v1.0  
(Re-establish architectural envelope)

### Step 4 — Load Startup Bundle v1.0  
(Apply boot profile: Full Operational)

### Step 5 — Resume Drift Item #6
