# Drift Tables — v0.1

This file serves as the initial container for all terminology, semantic, functional, and architectural drift identified during the reconciliation and evolution of the ECL / CIP-E / CFP ecosystem.

Drift is expected in any rapidly evolving cognitive or meta-cognitive system.  
This table provides a formalized structure for tracking, evaluating, and resolving such drift.

# Table Format

Each drift entry should follow this structure:

## Term:
(What concept drifted?)

## Drift Type:
- Semantic Drift  
- Functional Drift  
- Scope Drift  
- Layer Drift  
- Behavioral Drift  
- Cross-System Drift  
- Other (specify)

## Original Definition / Behavior:
(Verbatim or minimally modified snapshot of the earliest known version.)

## Drifted Definition / Behavior:
(What changed? Show the version that revealed the drift.)

## Impact Assessment:
- Minor / Moderate / Major  
- Localized or Systemic  
- Risk of Confusion: Low / Medium / High  
- Affected Subsystems:

## Root Cause Candidates:
- Ambiguity in CORE-PRIMER  
- Interaction between CFP → ECL layers  
- EnaC internal interpretation drift  
- Authorial reinterpretation  
- Multi-model interference  
- Overlapping terminology  
- Evolutionary necessity  
- Other

## Proposed Reconciliation Path:
(What action should be taken? Choose one.)
- Preserve original meaning  
- Preserve drifted meaning  
- Synthesize into new construct  
- Split into multiple constructs  
- Rename drifted form  
- Create system notes / warnings  
- Flag for T2/T3 specificity  
- Future research candidate

## Final Decision:
(To be filled collaboratively by Cash + EnaC during reconciliation sessions.)
