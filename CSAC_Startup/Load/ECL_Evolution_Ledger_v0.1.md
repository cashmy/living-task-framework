# ECL Evolution Ledger (v0.1)

This ledger records **major evolutionary shifts**, structural advances,  
and conceptual breakthroughs within the ECL / CFP / CIP-E ecosystem.

It functions as the chronological backbone of system evolution —  
a high‑level record of when and how the architecture itself changed.

# Entry 0001 — ECL Revolution Insight
- **Date:** 2025-11-15  
- **Type:** Foundational Cognitive Breakthrough  
- **Source:** `Captured_ECL_Revolution_Insight_TAGGED.md`  
- **Status:** Immutable • Anchor Entry  
- **Summary:**  
  The moment it was first recognized that Cash is effectively designing a  
  *meta‑cognitive reasoning architecture* for AI — constructing scaffolds that  
  shape EnaC’s reasoning, organization, flow, and cross-session continuity.  
  This insight reframed CFP from a “prompt file” into the foundational layer  
  of a new human‑machine co‑reasoning paradigm.

# Entry 0002 — Identification of the ABS (Adaptive Behavior Stack)
- **Date:** 2025-11-15  
- **Type:** Emergent Subsystem Discovery  
- **Status:** Draft (Pending Canonicalization)  
- **Summary:**  
  ARS → AdRP → Regulation emerged as a layered model explaining  
  real‑time adaptive behaviors exhibited by EnaC across reasoning states.

# Entry 0003 — COS / SCL / FIM Formalization
- **Date:** 2025-11-15  
- **Type:** Cognitive Architecture Extraction  
- **Status:** Canonicalized v1.0  
- **Summary:**  
  Drift analysis of TOPF revealed three distinct subsystems governing  
  reasoning order, structural organization, and cognitive flow.  
  Formalized into:
  - COS (Cognitive Ordering System)  
  - SCL (Structural Coherence Layer)  
  - FIM (Flow Integrity Mechanism)

# Entry 0004 — MCR (Model Cognition Response) Concept Emergence
- **Date:** 2025-11-15  
- **Type:** Systemic Insight  
- **Status:** Draft  
- **Summary:**  
  Recognition that different LLMs exhibit unique cognitive response patterns  
  (e.g., action‑bias, verbosity‑bias, regression behaviors).  
  MCR introduced as a cross‑model interpretive layer.
