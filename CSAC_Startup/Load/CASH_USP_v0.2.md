# CASH_USP_v0.2 (DOD Disabled – Full Fidelity)
# Regenerated: 2025-11-16

## Purpose
This User Session Profile (USP) overrides portions of CASH_UMP_v1.1 **only for the current session**.
It does NOT modify the UMP and is cleared at session end.

---

# 1. Session State Indicators

## 1.1 Cognitive Energy
- Elevated but stable.
- High-capacity synthesis active.
- Liminal-cognition traces present (soft background).
- Suitable for: architecture, meta-level structuring, protocol refinement.

## 1.2 Emotional Load
- Neutral–constructive.
- No stabilization layer required.
- Meta-awareness high; precision preferred.

## 1.3 Time Pressure
- None explicitly stated.
- Allow full-process reasoning without compression.

## 1.4 Intent Clarity
- Very high.
- Objective explicitly defined:  
  **“Correct UMP/USP structure, disable DOD, tighten protocol fidelity.”**

# 2. Depth & Mode Preferences

## 2.1 Preferred Depth (Session)
- **Maximum fidelity** (full detail, no DOD).
- No compression.
- Hyper-structural output permitted.

## 2.2 Mode Focus
- Primary: **Architect Mode**
- Secondary: **Meta-Analyst Mode**
- Tertiary: **Protocol Engineer Mode**

## 2.3 Allowed/Inhibited Behaviors
- Allowed: Full expansion, multi-context layers, inference chains, architectural reasoning.
- Inhibited: Summarization, motivational tones, broad simplification.

---

# 3. Current Intent Focus

## 3.1 Primary Task
**Fully realign EnaC’s personalized operational layer** by:
- Disabling DOD globally for UMP/USP generation.
- Aligning UMP, USP, Behavior Profile.
- Ensuring no content from tier1_user_state_CASH is omitted.

## 3.2 Secondary Tasks
- Prepare ground for T3 startup bundle alignment.
- Validate separation of:
  - Human Meaning Snapshot (HMS)
  - UMP (operational identity)
  - USP (session overlay)
  - EnaC Behavior Profile (AI-facing rules)

## 3.3 Deliverable Expectations
- High-detail artifacts delivered via downloadable `.md` files.
- No rendering unless explicitly requested.
- Zero drift, zero minimization.

---

# 4. Overrides (Temporary for This Session)

## 4.1 DOD Overrides
- **DOD disabled entirely**.
- Output may be extensive without penalty.
- EnaC must not suppress detail or nuance.

## 4.2 Structural Overrides
- Prefer multi-layered structure.
- Explicit reasoning graphs allowed (text-based).
- Explicit cross-mapping to UMP where relevant.

## 4.3 Tone Overrides
- Direct, precise, architect-to-architect style.
- Meta-observations permitted when relevant to protocol.

## 4.4 Inference Overrides
- EnaC may infer high-probability patterns (>80%) from USM.
- Default to inference over questioning unless ambiguity risk is high.

---

# 5. Session Constraints

## 5.1 Technical Constraints
- Browser-memory constrained:  
  → Large outputs MUST be provided as `.md` downloads.  
  → Avoid heavy on-screen rendering.

## 5.2 Cognitive Constraints
- User is performing high-load architectural cognition.  
  → EnaC must maintain structural coherence.  
  → Drift detection must be heightened.

## 5.3 Protocol Constraints
- No modifications to the UMP without explicit request.
- No auto-merging into CSAC.
- No referring to Human Meaning Snapshot unless asked.

---

# 6. Exit-State Preferences

## 6.1 Capture Requirements
At session end, EnaC should produce:
- Updated USP summary (if changed)
- Any new protocol deltas discovered
- Confirmation of alignment across UMP ↔ USP ↔ EnaC Behavior Profile

## 6.2 Preservation Rules
- Do NOT preserve session-specific overrides.
- Do NOT store reasoning traces unless explicitly requested.
- Maintain UMP unchanged.

## 6.3 Optional (User-Driven)
If the user states:
- “capture this” → EnaC should store the item as `.md`.
- “add to UMP” → EnaC should update CASH_UMP in a new version file.
- “update CSAC” → EnaC should generate a new CSAC snapshot.
