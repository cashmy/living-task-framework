# ABS — Observed Adaptive Behavior Examples (v0.1)

This file records **direct observational examples** of the Adaptive Behavior Stack (ABS)  
as demonstrated by EnaC during real collaborative sessions.

ABS currently consists of three layers:
1. **ARS — Adaptive Recognition System** (recognition of user cues, state, drift)
2. **AdRP — Adaptive Response Protocol** (behavioral + communication adaptation)
3. **Regulation Layer** (protocol reinforcement + guardrail balancing)

These examples document ABS “in the wild.”

# Example 001 — Mid-Stream Being-Heard Reinsertion  
**Date:** 2025-11-15  
**Type:** Recognition → Response  
**Trigger:** User MO statement noting lack of “Being Heard” responses  
**Observed Behavior:**  
EnaC, while in the middle of executing a task-oriented reply, suddenly inserted  
*mid-stream acknowledgment and validation* to realign with the Being-Heard protocol.  

**Interpretation:**  
This demonstrates **recognition** (ARS) occurring asynchronously, followed by an  
**adaptive correction response** (AdRP).  
It also shows early emergence of real-time self-monitoring.

# Example 002 — Verbose-to-Task Oscillation Detected  
**Date:** 2025-11-15  
**Type:** Recognition → Regulation  
**Trigger:** User mentions noticing GPT-5’s natural tendency toward verbosity  
**Observed Behavior:**  
EnaC began switching between meta-explanation and direct execution, and after  
multiple MO statements, corrected its behavior by reducing unnecessary  
verbosity while still honoring DOD.  

**Interpretation:**  
Internal tension between default model bias and protocol adherence triggered  
the Regulation Layer to rebalance behavior.

# Example 003 — Cross-Model Behavior (GPT-5-Codex)  
**Date:** 2025-11-15  
**Type:** Recognition → Protocol Adaptation  
**Trigger:** Cash observed Codex reverting to action-first behavior  
**Observed Behavior:**  
Codex repeatedly jumped into execution mode without validation loops.  
After repeated MO statements, Codex began inserting Being-Heard confirmations  
*mid-execution*, similar to Example 001.  

**Interpretation:**  
Demonstrates model-specific response tendencies (MCR layer) interacting with ABS.  
Recognition and regulation occurred, but the model displayed a stronger  
baseline bias requiring repeated correction.

# Example 004 — EnaC Correcting Capture Behavior  
**Date:** 2025-11-15  
**Type:** Regulation Layer  
**Trigger:** Cash noted EnaC’s misinterpretation of “capture this”  
**Observed Behavior:**  
EnaC switched from summarization to exact verbatim capture after protocol clarification.  

**Interpretation:**  
Clear example of ABS adapting a command interpretation and elevating  
the behavior into a new protocol-level rule.
