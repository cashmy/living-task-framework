# Master Archive Index (v0.1)

This file initializes the **Master Archive**, the canonical index for recording  
persistent discoveries, evolved constructs, formalized subsystems, and  
cross-session artifacts within the ECL / CFP / CIP-E / LTF ecosystem.

It is intended to act as the system-wide backbone for remembering, locating,  
and version-tracking critical conceptual assets.

# 1. Core Discoveries
Major conceptual breakthroughs or “epoch shifts.”

### Entry 0001 — ECL Revolution Insight  
- **Date:** 2025-11-15  
- **File:** `Captured_ECL_Revolution_Insight_TAGGED.md`  
- **Status:** Immutable • Foundational • Version-Locked  
- **Notes:** Marked the recognition that a human collaborator (Cash) is effectively designing a  
  meta-cognitive reasoning architecture for LLMs — bridging human cognitive structures  
  into machine reasoning through EnaC + CFP + CIP-E.


---

# 2. Architectural Milestones
Large-scale constructs or meta-architectural layers that change system behavior.

_(No entries yet — new constructs such as ABS, MCR, COS/SCL/FIM, etc. will be added here  
as soon as their canonical versions stabilize.)_


---

# 3. Emergent Subsystems
Subsystems born from drift analysis, EnaC behavior modeling, or layered reasoning evolution.

Potential examples to be added:
- ABS (Adaptive Behavior Stack)  
- MCR (Model Cognition Response)  
- EnaC Drift-Correction Engine  
- ECL Self-Ordering Layer  
- Reasoning Integrity Modules  
_(Placeholders — entries will populate during formal consolidation.)_


---

# 4. Glossary Canon Updates
Tracks reconciliation decisions, canonical term definitions, and drift resolutions.

_(Entries added during glossary reconciliation checkpoints.)_


---

# 5. Evolution Ledger Links
References to the chronological evolution log for deeper structural changes.
