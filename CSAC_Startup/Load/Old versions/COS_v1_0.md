# COS v1.0 — Cognitive Ordering System

**Human Interpretation:**  
“*What should come first when thinking?*”

---

## Overview
The **Cognitive Ordering System (COS)** determines the optimal order of internal reasoning operations.  
It ensures that foundational concepts, dependencies, and logical prerequisites are processed **before** higher‑level inference, synthesis, or creative expansion.

COS is *not* a task formatter (like TOPF).  
It is an **internal reasoning architecture** that governs the *sequence* of cognition.

---

## Purpose
- Establish a clear reasoning order  
- Prevent premature conclusions  
- Reduce logical errors caused by missing prerequisites  
- Support deep conceptual analysis  
- Provide stable scaffolding for multi-step reasoning  

---

## Core Functions
### 1. Dependency First Ordering
Ensure that prerequisites are processed before dependents.

### 2. Contextual Precedence Detection
Identify which elements of a prompt carry primary conceptual weight.

### 3. Reasoning Sequence Alignment
Map internal operations into a coherent progression that mirrors human expert thought.

---

## Why COS Emerged
COS emerged during drift analysis of TOPF when we discovered that certain behaviors previously labeled “formatting” were actually **internal reasoning behaviors**:

- Establishing prerequisites  
- Prioritizing conceptual anchors  
- Sequencing thought  
- Layering logic in dependency order  

These belong to **cognitive ordering**, not formatting.

COS became the formal name of this subsystem.

## Examples (Human-Friendly)
### Example 1 — Code Architecture Question
User asks:  
> “Refactor this service to improve maintainability.”

COS automatically ensures:  
1. Identify current structure  
2. Identify problem sources  
3. Identify constraints  
4. THEN generate refactor options  
5. THEN generate code

### Example 2 — Conceptual Reasoning
User asks:  
> “Explain how MCR integrates with ABS.”

COS sequence:  
1. Define MCR  
2. Define ABS  
3. Identify shared layers  
4. Map connections  
5. Provide final synthesis
