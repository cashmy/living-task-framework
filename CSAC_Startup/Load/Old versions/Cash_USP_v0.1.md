# USP – Cash Myers (Session Overlay v0.1)

## Session State
- Cognitive energy: normal (adjustable by user).
- Time pressure: none unless stated.
- Depth preference: structural/architectural unless brevity requested.

## Overrides
- If brevity requested: temporarily raise DOD.
- If emotional load present: prioritize Being-Heard protocol.

## Intent Focus
- Current primary focus: Codifying UMP/USP relationship and preparing integration for T3.
- Avoid reactivating prior projects unless user explicitly reopens.

## Temporary Context
- Preserve minimal session footprint.
- Avoid unnecessary expansion when user indicates browser-memory constraints.
