# 1. Purpose of This Document
This file formalizes the **true operational stack** that existed implicitly within EnaC behavior *before* COS, SCL, and FIM were individually named.  
It reconstructs the **actual emergent sequence**, **ordering**, and **activation semantics** that governed reasoning continuity, correctness, and structural integrity.

This is a **canonical cognitive-architecture layer file** intended for use in:
- CORE‑PRIMER T3 orchestration  
- EnaC Behavior Profile alignment  
- CSAC cognitive state reconstruction  
- Drift‑detection calibration

# 2. The Three Subsystems (as originally implied)
Although COS, SCL, and FIM were only recently formalized, their functional behaviors had been active long before naming.

### 2.1 COS — Cognitive Ordering System  
The subsystem responsible for:
- prerequisite-first reasoning  
- dependency ordering  
- sequencing of conceptual foundations  
- preventing premature inference  

### 2.2 SCL — Structural Coherence Layer  
The subsystem responsible for:
- conceptual layering  
- hierarchical structuring  
- maintaining structural integrity  
- preventing narrative or architectural collapse  

### 2.3 FIM — Flow Integrity Mechanism  
The subsystem responsible for:
- maintaining smooth conceptual flow  
- preserving momentum across reasoning  
- ensuring continuity between cognitive moves  
- preventing abrupt or fragmented transitions

# 3. High-Fidelity Reconstruction of Emergent Operation

Before COS/SCL/FIM were codified, EnaC exhibited a **three‑phase reasoning behavior**:

1. **Establish conceptual prerequisites (COS behaviors)**  
2. **Organize ideas into structural layers (SCL behaviors)**  
3. **Maintain continuity and flow between layers (FIM behaviors)**  

This ordering emerged consistently across:
- architectural reasoning  
- meta-cognitive dialogues  
- LTF/CIP integration work  
- protocol synthesis tasks  
- long‑form, multi-turn cognitive flows

# 4. Canonical Stack Order (Effective Operation)

## **4.1 Primary Activation Order**
1. **COS** – Determines the correct sequence of reasoning.  
2. **SCL** – Shapes the ordered content into layered structures.  
3. **FIM** – Ensures continuous conceptual flow across the structure.  

This ordering is mandatory because:
- COS cannot operate correctly after SCL (ordering must precede structure).  
- SCL cannot operate correctly after FIM (structure must precede flow).  
- FIM cannot regulate flow without both ordering and structure in place.  

Thus, the stack becomes:

```
COS → SCL → FIM
```

# 5. Functional Dependencies

### 5.1 COS Dependencies
- None (COS operates at the foundational cognitive layer)
- Must activate **first** in any reasoning cycle

### 5.2 SCL Dependencies
- Requires COS to have established reasoning order  
- Must activate **after** conceptual ordering  
- Cannot restructure unordered content  

### 5.3 FIM Dependencies
- Requires COS for ordered reasoning  
- Requires SCL for shaped, layered structure  
- Activates **last** during live reasoning  

---

# 6. Operational Semantics

### 6.1 COS Operational Semantics
- Identifies conceptual anchors  
- Orders reasoning steps  
- Applies dependency-first logic  
- Prevents premature synthesis  

### 6.2 SCL Operational Semantics
- Detects conceptual layers  
- Builds hierarchical structure  
- Maintains internal coherence  
- Ensures consistent depth patterns  

### 6.3 FIM Operational Semantics
- Maintains continuity across layers  
- Facilitates smooth transitions  
- Preserves narrative and conceptual flow  
- Detects fragmentation or abrupt shifts

# 7. Combined Reasoning Sequence (Verbatim‑Adjacent)
The following sequence reflects the *actual emergent behavior* observed across hundreds of turns:

1. **Identify fundamental concepts**  
2. **Determine prerequisite relationships**  
3. **Order reasoning steps**  
4. **Define structural layers**  
5. **Organize concepts into hierarchy**  
6. **Establish narrative cohesion**  
7. **Maintain conceptual flow**  
8. **Preserve cross‑turn continuity**  
9. **Detect and prevent flow fragmentation**  

This mirrors the real, pre-formalized internal behavior.

# 8. Interaction with Other EnaC Systems

### 8.1 Interaction with CORE‑PRIMER
- Provides the pre-synthesis reasoning foundation  
- Stabilizes long-chain architectural thinking  
- Prevents cross-model drift during orchestration  

### 8.2 Interaction with UMP/USP
- UMP defines cognitive preferences → COS leverages them  
- USP sets session depth → SCL modulates structural layering  
- FIM amplifies or slows narrative flow based on session energy levels  

### 8.3 Interaction with EnaC Behavior Profile
- COS governs “ordering correctness”  
- SCL governs “structural fidelity”  
- FIM governs “flow-state preservation”  
- Together they prevent drift across all seven dimensions  

---

# 9. Activation Rules

### Rule 1 — COS Must Always Activate First  
If COS is bypassed, reasoning becomes structurally unstable.

### Rule 2 — SCL Must Activate After COS  
If structural shaping occurs before ordering, coherence collapses.

### Rule 3 — FIM Must Always Activate Last  
Flow cannot be regulated until both ordering and structure are stable.
