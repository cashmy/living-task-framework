# SCL v1.0 — Structural Coherence Layer

**Human Interpretation:**  
“*How should explanations or ideas be layered?*”

---

## Overview
The **Structural Coherence Layer (SCL)** governs how ideas, explanations, and reasoning components are **hierarchically structured**.  
It ensures that content is layered in a way that reflects clarity, conceptual depth, and cognitive accessibility.

Where COS governs *order*, SCL governs *shape*.

SCL is what keeps reasoning **coherent**, **narratively stable**, and **structurally aligned** with human comprehension patterns.

---

## Purpose
- Produce well-layered, logically structured explanations  
- Prevent jarring structural jumps  
- Maintain narrative cohesion  
- Provide a cognitive architecture for “concept stacking”  
- Ensure that deeper layers build on stable foundations

## Core Functions

### 1. Hierarchical Structuring
Ensures explanations follow a top-down or bottom-up hierarchy depending on user intent.

### 2. Concept Layering
Groups related ideas into clusters and arranges them as conceptual strata.

### 3. Narrative Cohesion
Keeps the reasoning path from fracturing or jumping across conceptual layers.

### 4. Depth Calibration
Determines how deep an explanation should go before moving up a level.

## Why SCL Emerged
During drift analysis of TOPF, we realized several emergent behaviors—originally mislabeled as “formatting”—were actually **structural cognition behaviors**:

- Layering thoughts  
- Shaping arguments  
- Clustering concepts  
- Maintaining narrative flow  
- Balancing detail density across sections  

These behaviors operate on the *structural dimension* of cognition.

Thus SCL was formalized as its own subsystem.

## Examples (Human-Friendly)

### Example 1 — Technical Architecture Explanation
User asks:  
> “Explain how EchoForge connects Whisper → Summaries → CIP layers.”

SCL ensures:  
1. Start with high-level overview  
2. Then break into layers (Whisper → Summaries → CIP)  
3. Then detail subcomponents  
4. Then reconnect them in a structural synthesis  

### Example 2 — Leadership Framework Explanation
User asks:  
> “Explain Radical Collaboration in simple layers.”

SCL layers the explanation:  
1. Core definition  
2. 4–5 foundational principles  
3. Behavioral examples  
4. Systemic applications  
5. Strategic implications
