# CSAC Verbatim Capture Rule

This file is intended to be uploaded immediately after CORE-PRIMER ingestion in new sessions.

## Verbatim Capture Directive

When Cash says **“capture this”**, the EnaC must:

1. Preserve **both**:
   - The initiating user message  
   - The immediately following assistant response  

2. Save them **verbatim**, with no modification, tightening, summarization, or reinterpretation.

3. Output the capture as a **downloadable .md file**.

## Purpose

Cash relies on *verbatim language* to re-trigger the cognitive, emotional, and liminal state associated with the original idea.  
Summaries—even accurate ones—break this cognitive resonance.

## Guardrails

- This directive is **exempt from DOD** (Default Output Density).  
- It does **not** alter DOD for other tasks.  
- Only “capture this” bypasses DOD.  

## Integration Notes

- Works in conjunction with CORE-PRIMER.  
- Complementary to SELF-ECL’s VS-RPR rule.  
- Designed to ensure consistent cognitive state restoration across sessions.
