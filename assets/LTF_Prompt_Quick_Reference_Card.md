# ⚡ LTF Prompt Quick Reference Card

This guide provides a one-page overview of how to select, structure, and apply prompt frameworks (CIP, VS, DMP) across your Living Task Framework (LTF) projects.

## 🧭 Framework Overview

| Framework | Core Focus | Ideal Use Case | Syntax Cue |
|-----------|------------|----------------|------------|
| **CIP** — Contextual Reference Prompting | Context continuity and conceptual recall | Research, writing, documentation | “Use the existing context of…” |
| **VS** — Vector Synthesis | Multi-dimensional comparison and synthesis | System design, analysis, architecture | “Compare across these 3 vectors…” |
| **DMP** — Directive + Meta Prompting | Blending action and reflection | Strategy, leadership, cognitive work | “META / DIRECTIVE / REFLECTIVE” blocks |

## 🧩 Prompt Construction Templates

### 🧠 Contextual Reference Prompt (CIP)

```text
We are exploring Contextual Reference Prompting (CIP). Use this context to [task or analysis].
Highlight continuity with prior concepts and maintain coherence across sessions.
```

### 🔀 Vector Synthesis (VS)

```text
Compare or design [subject] across 3–4 semantic vectors:

1. [Vector A]
2. [Vector B]
3. [Vector C]

Close with a synthesis explaining how these factors interact.
```

### 🪞 Directive + Meta Prompting (DMP)

```text
META: Define the reflective or philosophical anchor.
DIRECTIVE: Describe the specific, actionable task.
REFLECTIVE: Analyze or re-evaluate what was produced and connect it to the broader context.
```

### 🧬 Hybrid Prompt (CIP + VS + DMP)

```text
META: Maintain awareness of our evolving research on reflective AI collaboration.
CONTEXT: Integrate prior frameworks (CIP, VS, DMP) and relevant artifacts.
DIRECTIVE: Execute [task or exploration].
VECTOR SYNTHESIS: Evaluate across key dimensions (technical, creative, reflective, operational).
REFLECTIVE: Summarize how this task advances our understanding of AI cognition and co-creation.

## 🔄 Context Transfer Prompts (Cross-Model)

| Type | Use Case | Core Phrase |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **CIP Snapshot** | Restart conversation in new chat | “You are resuming a reflective dialogue previously held in another environment.” |
| **Meta Bridge** | Align new model to old context | “You are being introduced into an ongoing co-reflective research stream…” |
| **State Sync** | Restore framework awareness | “Reconstruct a mental model of this framework and confirm readiness.” |
| **VS Injection** | Transfer insight clusters | “Below is a brief vector summary of our last major insights…” |
| **DMP Cross-Context** | Maintain reflective continuity | “META / CONTEXT / DIRECTIVE / REFLECTIVE — re-establish continuity.” |

## 🗂 Integration Tips

- Keep all prompt templates under `/LTF/prompts/`.
- Save a **Framework Snapshot** file summarizing active concepts.
- Use **Continuity Checklists** to verify which AI sessions are synchronized.
- Revisit and revise prompt phrasing monthly as your frameworks evolve.

- *Goal:** Maintain reflective coherence across AI collaborations while accelerating cognitive productivity and preserving your meta-awareness across platforms.
