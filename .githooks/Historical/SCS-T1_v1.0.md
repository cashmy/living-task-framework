# SCS-T1_v1.0
# System Consolidation Snapshot — Terse Core (Alphabetized)
# Date: 2025-11-16

This document contains the **minimal, ultra-terse, alphabetized core definitions**  
for the EnaC / T3 / ABS / CSAC / CORE-PRIMER ecosystem.  
It is the semantic anchor for the entire framework.

---

# A

### ABS — Adaptive Behavior Signaling  
Pattern observation; readiness scoring; cannot personalize.

### Activation Order  
CORE-PRIMER → EBP → UMP → USP.

---

# C

### CSAC — Cross-Session AI Context  
Stores EnaC state + metadata only; never human meaning.

### Capture (STMG)  
Verbatim trigger-response preservation.

### CORE-PRIMER  
Foundational constraints; must load first.

---

# D

### DOD — Degree of Detail  
Controls compression/expansion; neutral by default.

---

# E

### EBP — EnaC Behavior Profile  
Behavioral OS; governs drift, tone, mode, safety.

### EnaC  
Executive Natural Context Engine; runs behavioral framework.

---

# G

### Glossary  
Central canonical definitions; rebuilt after SCS.

---

# H

### Human Meaning Layer  
Never inferred, altered, or rewritten; Tier-1 invariant.

---

# M

### Meaning Preservation  
Strict rule preventing AI alteration of user meaning.

---

# R

### RDP — Refactor Discipline Protocol  
Requires human validation for structural changes.

---

# S

### SELF-ECL  
Human cognitive meaning architecture; not directive.

### SCS  
System Consolidation Snapshot: T1 (terse), T3 (org), T2 (expanded).

### STMG  
Semantic-Trigger Markdown; verbatim capture.

---

# T

### T3 — Tiered Framework  
T1 meaning; T2 behavior; T3 coordination.

### Tier Alignment  
Strict boundaries across T1/T2/T3 interactions.

---

# U

### UMP — User Model Profile  
Identity baseline; non-presumptive; default or personalized.

### USP — User Session Profile  
Session overlay; temporary; non-personal.
