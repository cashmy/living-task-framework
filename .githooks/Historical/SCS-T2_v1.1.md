## RDP — Refactor Discipline Protocol
**Summary:** RDP defines the safety, sequencing, verification, and mandatory human-validation requirements for any refactoring of ecosystem artifacts (protocols, profiles, glossaries, architecture docs). It classifies refactor risk, mandates proposal-based changes, and forbids autonomous structural rewrites—ensuring meaning preservation and structural integrity across T1/T2/T3.

**Sources:** RDP_v1.0.md
**Tier Relevance:** Tier-1 invariant applied across T1/T2/T3; governs any structural modification to meaning-bearing or architectural documents.
**Related Terms:** EnaC, ABS, CSAC, CORE-PRIMER, UMP, USP, EBP, refactor, drift prevention
**Cluster:** Safety / Governance / Refactor Control

## STMG (Semantic Trigger Markdown Generator)
**Summary:** STMG is a governed export subsystem that produces verbatim, insertion-safe markdown artifacts pairing the semantic trigger prompt (the user instruction that causally produced a response) with the exact assistant output. It replaces the informal “Capture This” pattern with a deterministic, cross-LLM-stable capture mechanism that is exempt from compression and DOD controls.

**Sources:** STMG_v0.2.md
**Tier Relevance:** Parallel to T1–T3; not a reasoning mode but an export/logging subsystem used by CSAC, ECL reflection, and multi-LLM workflows.
**Related Terms:** CSAC, CORE-PRIMER Extension (STR), DOD-1 exemption, Capture This, CIP-E, ECL
**Cluster:** Export / Logging Subsystem
