# RESUME Snapshot - Cross-Session Handoff Guide

* *Snapshot Created**: 2025-11-09_165956
* *Project**: living-task-framework
* *Type**: RESUME (Cross-Session Transfer)

- --

## Purpose

This is a **RESUME snapshot** - designed for seamless AI session handoff.
Unlike regular snapshots, this includes:

- ✅ Snapshot of \.ltf-influencers.yaml\ (manifest state at handoff time)
- ✅ Enhanced transfer prompt with work context
- ✅ Session state with implementation status
- ✅ Handoff-specific instructions (this file)

## How to Resume Work in New AI Session

### Step 1: Upload Files

Upload these files to your new AI session (ChatGPT/Claude/other):

1. **\  ransfer-prompt.md\** (required)
2. **\session-state.yaml\** (recommended)
3. **\.ltf-influencers.yaml\** (optional - shows manifest state)

### Step 2: Paste Transfer Prompt

Copy the contents of **transfer-prompt.md** and paste into the AI chat.

The AI will immediately have:

- Project context and repository info
- All influencer files (via GitHub URLs)
- Framework knowledge (LTF methodologies)
- Session continuity (what was done, what's next)

### Step 3: Continue Work

Ask the AI to resume work. Example prompt:

\\\
Resume work on [describe current task].

Refer to session-state.yaml for:

- Implementation status (what's done vs. what's needed)
- Work context (what we're building)
- Next steps

Let's continue where we left off.

## Files in This Snapshot

| File | Purpose | Upload to AI? |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **transfer-prompt.md** | Context restoration | ✅ Required |
| **session-state.yaml** | Session details | ✅ Recommended |
| **RESUME_README.md** | This guide | ℹ️ Optional |

## What to Expect

* *Time to productivity**: <2 minutes
* *Context transfer success rate**: 95-100% (validated with ChatGPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5)

The AI should:

- ✅ Understand the project and repository
- ✅ Know what frameworks to apply (CIP-E, DMP, VS Suite)
- ✅ Reference the right influencer files
- ✅ Continue where the previous session left off

## Troubleshooting

### AI Seems Confused About the Task

* *Problem**: AI starts working on wrong files or misunderstands scope
* *Solution**: Check \session-state.yaml\ → \work_context\ section

Clarify:

- "This is framework development, not project development"
- "Modify [specific file], don't touch [other files]"

### AI Re-implements Existing Features

* *Problem**: AI writes code for something already done
* *Solution**: Point to \implementation_status\ in session-state.yaml

Say: "Check implementation_status - [feature] is already complete at [location]"

### AI Doesn't Know Where Files Are

* *Problem**: AI can't find files or asks for paths
* *Solution**: Reference the GitHub URLs in influencer list

Files are linked in transfer-prompt.md with full GitHub blob URLs.

## Command Line Usage

If you need to create or resume snapshots from the command line:

### PowerShell (Windows, Mac, Linux)

\\\pwsh

# Create a new RESUME snapshot

pwsh tools/context/Save-LTFContext-v2.ps1 -Type resume -Label "my-checkpoint"

# Resume from a snapshot

pwsh tools/context/Resume-LTF.ps1 -Project my-project -Type resume -Latest
\\\

## Bash (Mac, Linux, WSL)

\\\ash

# Create a new RESUME snapshot

bash tools/context/save-ltf-context.sh -type resume -label "my-checkpoint"

# Resume from a snapshot

bash tools/context/resume-ltf.sh -project my-project -type resume -latest
\\\

* *See**: \  ools/context/CLI_GUIDE.md\ for comprehensive command line documentation

- --

## Advanced: Work Context

This RESUME snapshot includes **work context metadata** to prevent AI scope creep:

* **work_type**: framework-development | project-development | documentation | research
* **primary_target**: What system is being modified
* **dogfooding**: Whether using LTF to build LTF (meta-work)
* **implementation_status**: What exists vs. what's needed

See \session-state.yaml\ for details.

- --

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Upload \  ransfer-prompt.md\ to new AI session
2. ✅ Paste contents into chat
3. ✅ Ask AI to resume work
4. ✅ Provide clarifications if needed (reference session-state.yaml)

* *Estimated time**: 1-2 minutes to full productivity
