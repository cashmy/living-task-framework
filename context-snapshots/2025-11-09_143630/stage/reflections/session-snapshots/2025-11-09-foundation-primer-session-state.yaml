    User said "I am reeling from the possibilities but more from the potential 
    increase in creativity and problem solving using AI collaboration natively!"
    
    "Reeling" indicates:
    - Positive overwhelm (not negative stress)
    - Multiple insights compounding faster than processing speed
    - Paradigm-shift recognition happening in real-time
    - Excitement mixed with cognitive dissonance (worldview expanding)

  notes: |
    This snapshot was created as part of the session it documents.
    It serves three purposes:
    1. Example of what automated Save-LTFContext should generate
    2. Guide for extraction template development
    3. Verification that our LTF understanding is correct
    
    User's observation: "notice how I looped that back to our original goals"
    → This snapshot loops back to Save-LTFContext refactoring goals by BEING
       the artifact that Save-LTFContext should create.
    
    Meta-loop complete: Tool design → Use case → Product vision → Tool validation
