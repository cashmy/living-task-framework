# 🧭 Living Task Framework — Operational Plan v1

- *Purpose:** Enable repeatable and quantitative experimentation across different models and frameworks.

- --

## **7. Reflective Analytics Layer**

- *Goal:** Extend the Reflective Dashboard to include analytical tracking for performance and coherence metrics.

- **Deliverables:**

- Time-to-clarity metric
- Hallucination avoidance indicators
- Meta-recognition frequency tracker

- *Purpose:** Build an evidence-driven feedback loop for reflective performance evaluation.

- --

### **8. CIP-DMP Comparative Repository**

- *Goal:** Create a public-facing microsite or repository showcasing TOFP → DMP → CIP transformations.

- **Deliverables:**

- Repository with annotated examples
- Visual comparison of before/after prompts
- Optional audience feedback form

- *Purpose:** Serve as a live proof-of-concept hub demonstrating framework utility.

- --

### **9. Publication Chain Mapping**

- *Goal:** Design a publication pipeline connecting research → articles → whitepapers → book chapters.

- **Deliverables:**

- Flowchart of publication dependencies
- Content progression roadmap
- Release coordination matrix

- *Purpose:** Maintain contextual continuity and progressive audience development.

- --

### **10. Cross-Model Prompt Comparison Study (Advanced)**

- *Goal:** Evaluate how different LLMs (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet, Gemini Advanced, etc.) respond to reflective prompt structures.

- **Deliverables:**

- Controlled prompt dataset
- Comparative analysis of meta-response quality
- Summary whitepaper on reflective cognition variance across models

- *Purpose:** Establish credibility and depth through multi-model validation research.
