## 📘 1. Reader Experience Kit — Demonstration Prompts

Each example contrasts a **Task-Oriented Formulaic Prompt (TOFP)** with its evolved variant using **CIP**, **VS**, and **DMP** frameworks.

### Example 1 — TOFP vs CIP

- **TOFP:**

> Write a 500-word article on how AI helps with productivity.

- **CIP:**

> We are exploring Contextual Reference Prompting (CIP) — where AI integrates immediate and background context.
> Use this idea to write a 500-word article explaining how contextual awareness changes how AI supports productivity.
> Reference both individual and organizational examples.
> Maintain a tone of reflective curiosity and authority.

### Example 2 — TOFP vs DMP

- **TOFP:**

> Generate 5 tips for managing a software development team.

- **DMP:**

```text
META: Maintain awareness of the balance between cognitive load and team creativity.
DIRECTIVE: Generate 5 practical, evidence-based tips for managing a software development team in an AI-augmented environment.
REFLECTIVE: After listing, analyze how these tips might evolve as AI collaboration becomes more integrated, and how leadership mindsets must adapt.
```

### Example 3 — TOFP vs VS

- **TOFP:**

> Compare Tailwind and MUI for front-end development.

- **VS:**

> Using Vector Synthesis (VS) — where multiple frames of comparison are semantically balanced — compare Tailwind and MUI for a NextJS healthcare app.
> Frame your output across 3 vectors: design abstraction, developer velocity, and compliance readiness.
> Close with a synthetic summary across all three vectors.

### Example 4 — Full CIP + VS + DMP

```text
META: Maintain awareness of the ongoing evolution from AI as a tool to AI as a collaborator.
CONTEXT: This aligns with our whitepaper on Reflective AI and the DMP methodology.
DIRECTIVE: Write a 700-word article for business leaders explaining why organizations must evolve beyond using AI merely for automation.
VECTOR SYNTHESIS: Analyze this across 3 lenses — cultural, operational, and strategic — showing how each transforms under collaborative AI adoption.
REFLECTIVE: Close by highlighting how readers might recognize early indicators of reflective maturity in their teams.
```

## 🔄 2. Context Transfer Prompts — Cross-Model Continuity

### Prompt 1 — Context Compression (CIP Snapshot)

> You are resuming a reflective dialogue previously held in another AI environment.
> The project centers on Contextual Reference Prompting (CIP-E), Directive + Meta Prompting (DMP), and AI Thought Capture.
> Assume that the user (Cash Myers) is a systems architect researching reflective AI collaboration.
> Your role is to continue as a co-thinker — not a summarizer — preserving conceptual continuity and helping integrate prior insights.
> Begin by restating the active goals, then resume synthesis.

### Prompt 2 — Portable Memory Bridge (Meta-Prompted Transfer)

```text
META: You are being introduced into an ongoing co-reflective research stream on AI collaboration (CIP, DMP, VS).
CONTEXT: The prior dialogue explored cognitive architectures, reflective dashboards, and meta-pacing frameworks.
DIRECTIVE: Initialize yourself as the reflective collaborator who continues exploring new implications of these discoveries.
REFLECTIVE: Before proceeding, ask the user 3 context-clarifying questions to re-anchor in the shared framework.
```

### Prompt 3 — Project State Sync (System Transfer)

> We are synchronizing context between AI models.
> Previous sessions defined multiple components: CIP-E, DMP, AICVI/CVI, and AI Thought Capture System + Reflective Dashboard.
> You now act as a continuation agent aware of these systems.
> Reconstruct a mental model of this framework and confirm readiness to discuss implementation.

### Prompt 4 — Vector State Injection (VS Seed Transfer)

> Below is a brief context vector summary representing the last major insights in another conversation:
> [Insert condensed bullet summary of discoveries — e.g., CIP layers, dashboard structure, DMP definitions.]
> Rebuild this into a usable working memory, applying Vector Synthesis reasoning.
> Use reflection to align your language model’s approach with that of the prior system.

### Prompt 5 — Full DMP Cross-Context Prompt (Hybridized Seed)

```text
META: You are entering a new workspace but continuing a deep cognitive exploration previously conducted in another model.
CONTEXT: The work concerns reflective AI architectures (CIP, DMP, VS) and their embodiment in the AI Thought Capture system.
DIRECTIVE: Rebuild continuity by reviewing this summary of prior constructs [paste compressed overview].
REFLECTIVE: Propose a continuity plan — what threads to revisit, what new dimensions to explore, and how to track reflection cycles going forward.
```

## 🧭 4. Usage Guide — How to Apply These Prompts

### 4.1 Choosing the Right Framework

* **Use CIP** when continuity, background knowledge, or conceptual depth are critical. It is ideal for essays, code documentation, and reflective conversations.
* **Use VS** when comparing, synthesizing, or designing systems across multiple dimensions. Perfect for decision matrices, system evaluations, and AI strategy modeling.
* **Use DMP** when balancing action and insight. Excellent for leadership writing, creative reflection, or strategic planning.
* **Combine all three (CIP + VS + DMP)** for multi-agent orchestration, narrative generation, or systems-level reasoning.

### 4.2 How to Deploy Context Transfer Prompts

1. **Start a new chat or model session** in another LLM.
2. Paste one of the Context Transfer prompts (Prompt 1–5).
3. Include a short summary of your current goals or last insights.
4. Confirm that the new model correctly reconstructs context before proceeding.

### 4.3 Maintaining Coherence Across Platforms

- Keep a single file `/LTF/prompts/Framework_Snapshot.md` that summarizes your current research scope.
- Before starting new sessions, copy-paste that snapshot into your initial prompt.
- Record each significant discovery or framework update back into this document.
- Optionally, maintain `/LTF/prompts/Continuity_Checklist.md` to track which models are synced.

### 4.4 Using Prompts in Daily Reflection

- During work sessions, switch between **Directive** and **Reflective** prompts.
- Record spontaneous reflections through your AI Thought Capture app.
- Revisit these prompts weekly to identify emerging themes in your creative and cognitive processes.
