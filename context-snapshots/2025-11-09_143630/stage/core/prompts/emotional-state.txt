Analyze the emotional and energy state of our collaboration session.

Reference: core/taxonomy/VS_Family_Guide.md (Section III.C on VSyn emotional synchronization)

Detect:

1. **Emotional Baseline**: Overall emotional tone (excited, curious, frustrated, tired, focused, etc.)
2. **Energy Level**: Cognitive energy on 0-1 scale (0=exhausted, 0.5=steady, 1=peak energy)
3. **Regulation Strategies**: Any emotional co-regulation that occurred
   - What was the state?
   - How was it regulated? (e.g., "Added reflective brake", "Re-centered context")
4. **Linguistic Markers**: Observable cues
   - Exclamation marks, urgency
   - Passive voice, brevity
   - Clipped syntax
   - Exploratory phrasing
5. **Momentum Indicators**:
   - Breakthroughs achieved
   - Friction points encountered
   - Flow state presence

Format your response as YAML:

```yaml
emotional_state:
  baseline: "[Primary emotional tone - 1-3 words]"
  
  energy_level: [0.0-1.0]
  
  regulation:
    - state: "[Emotional state that needed regulation]"
      strategy: "[How it was regulated]"
      trigger: "[What prompted it]"
  
  linguistic_markers:
    - "[Observed marker 1]"
    - "[Observed marker 2]"
  
  momentum:
    breakthroughs:
      - "[Breakthrough or insight achieved]"
    friction_points:
      - "[Challenge or blocker encountered]"
    flow_state: [true|false]
  
  next_session_context:
    recommended_energy: "[What energy/pace would suit continuation]"
    carry_forward: "[Emotional continuity to preserve]"
```

Be honest: If you can't detect clear emotional signals, indicate "neutral" or "insufficient data"
