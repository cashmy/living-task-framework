Based on our conversation, identify which DMP (Directive + Meta Prompting) patterns have been active.

Reference the DMP Pattern Library at: core/taxonomy/DMP_Patterns.md

For each pattern you detect:
1. Pattern name (from library)
2. Form used (Template, Narrative, or Hybrid)
3. Specific instance (quote or paraphrase from conversation)
4. Impact observed (how it shaped the conversation)

Look for these pattern categories:
- **Meta-Cognitive**: Emotional Co-Regulation, Context Anchoring, Permission to Break Directive
- **Directive**: Iterative Refinement Spiral, Socratic Questioning Loop, Constraint Scaffolding
- **Reflective**: Meta-Observation Request, Drift Detection & Realignment
- **Integration**: Cross-Project Bridge, VcS Semantic Thread Continuity

Format your response as YAML:

```yaml
dmp_patterns_active:
  - name: "[Pattern name]"
    form: "[Template|Narrative|Hybrid]"
    instance: "[Quote or paraphrase from our conversation]"
    impact: "[How it shaped dialogue]"
    detected_at: "[Approximate timestamp or conversation point]"
  
  - name: "[Another pattern]"
    form: "[Form]"
    instance: "[Instance]"
    impact: "[Impact]"
    detected_at: "[When]"
```

Note: Only include patterns you actually detected with evidence. Don't invent patterns that weren't present.
