Generate a complete VSyn (Variable Synchronicity) state for session handoff or context switching.

Reference: core/taxonomy/VS_Family_Guide.md (Section III on VSyn)

This captures the **process state** (how we're collaborating), not domain content.

Include:

1. **Emotional/Energy Synchronization** (from emotional-state.txt output)
2. **DMP Pattern Synchronization** (from dmp-patterns.txt output)
3. **Permission Boundaries**: What the human has/hasn't validated
   - Scope of permissions
   - Conditions/constraints
   - Justification requirements
4. **Meta-Process State**:
   - Phase of work (exploration, synthesis, refinement, validation)
   - Current focus area
   - Momentum assessment
   - Active blockers
5. **Temporal Synchronization**:
   - Last checkpoint/reflection
   - Recent decisions or pivots
   - Timeline context

Format your response as YAML:

```yaml
vsyn_state:
  # Emotional/Energy Synchronization
  emotional_baseline:
    state: "[Emotional tone]"
    regulation: "[Any regulation applied]"
    energy_level: [0.0-1.0]
  
  # DMP Pattern Synchronization
  active_patterns:
    - name: "[Pattern name]"
      form: "[Template|Narrative|Hybrid]"
      current_state: "[E.g., 'iteration 3' for Iterative Refinement]"
    - name: "[Another pattern]"
      form: "[Form]"
      current_state: "[State]"
  
  # Permission Boundary Synchronization
  permissions:
    - scope: "[What area permissions apply to]"
      type: "[E.g., constraint_relaxation, creative_expansion]"
      condition: "[When permission applies]"
      requires_justification: [true|false]
  
  # Meta-Process Synchronization
  process_state:
    phase: "[exploration|synthesis|refinement|validation]"
    focus: "[Current focus area in 3-5 words]"
    momentum: "[high|medium|low]"
    blockers:
      - "[Blocker 1 if any]"
  
  # Temporal Synchronization
  last_checkpoint:
    timestamp: "[Approximate time or 'N/A']"
    location: "[File path to checkpoint or 'none']"
    summary: "[1 sentence summary of checkpoint]"
  
  recent_context:
    - event: "[Recent decision/pivot/insight]"
      impact: "[How it affects continuation]"
```

This YAML will be embedded in session-state.md for context transfer.
