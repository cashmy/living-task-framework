Identify any **divergent threads** - creative tangents, spinoff ideas, or side explorations that emerged during our conversation but were not the main focus.

These are valuable insights that should be preserved for future exploration, even though they might have been "bookmarked" or "tabled for later".

For each divergent thread, capture:

1. **Brief Description**: What is the idea/tangent (1-2 sentences)
2. **Origin**: What triggered it in our conversation
3. **Relationship to Main Work**: How it connects to current project/focus
4. **Potential Value**: Why it's worth preserving
5. **Suggested Action**: What could be done with it
   - Create new project?
   - Add to research list?
   - Merge with existing work?
   - Just track for now?
6. **Related Projects/Domains**: What other work it might connect to

Format your response as a structured list:

Examples of divergent threads:
- "This made me think about writing a book on DMP patterns"
- "Could we use this approach for [different domain]?"
- "This connects to [other project] in an interesting way"
- "We should research [related topic] more deeply"

Only include threads that actually emerged - don't invent ideas that weren't mentioned.
