# Smart Contract API Specs

Reference documentation for on-chain contracts that power the EHR Consent Platform. Use the links below to open each spec.

- [ConsentRegistry](./ConsentRegistry.md) – Minimal consent state, lifecycle, and integration notes.
- [HospitalRegistry](./HospitalRegistry.md) – Hospital metadata, verification workflow, and membership epochs.
- [ProviderIdentity](./ProviderIdentity.md) – Provider verification, credential attestation, and hospital affiliation checks.

These markdown specs complement the Solidity sources under `contracts/src` and provide the context needed for SDKs, services, and audits.
