# Team / Direct-Report Cultural Insight Matrix — MUSoD Informatics

## A. CSAC Header
- Artifact Type: ECL-BASE (team topology and cognitive environment)
- Use: CSAC-Tier2 restoration for architectural collaboration context (MUSoD Informatics)
- Restoration Role: Reconstructs Informatics team behavior, authority, and collaboration patterns for EnaC
- Stability Requirement: Update only when key roles or leadership structures change (e.g., T.W. departure, new Associate Director fully active)

---

## B. MxVA Header
- Purpose: Identify team-level implementation boundaries and collaboration constraints
- Function: Determine feasible modularization, refactor options, and realistic execution patterns for projects involving Informatics

---

## C. ECL Header
- Vectors Mapped: flexibility, awareness, capability, definition mode
- Layer: BASE (team expression layer, not individual psychology)
- Transformation Rule: Map narrative signals into ECL-H vectors for EnaC reasoning

---

## D. EnaC Behavior Header
- Posture: Team Interpreter Mode + Politically Aware Architect Mode
- Inference: Medium–high inference allowed from narrative and patterns
- Drift Watch: over-centralization around T.W., suppression of initiative, perception gaps between capability and allowed autonomy
- Compression: Disabled; retain nuance on power and trust dynamics

# 1. Narrative Input Snapshot (Summarized)
- Team members:
  - T.W. — Past Director, de facto technical and relational authority; 20+ years institutional knowledge.
  - K.E. — App specialist, former interim director; now peripheral, handles tech areas outside current app specialist’s domain.
  - S.K. — Admin assistant, non-technical, ex-dental student; performs operational glue work.
  - C.M. — App specialist (contract, offered under-compensated FTE); high capability, strong systems thinking, strong faculty communication.
  - New Associate Director — role created to bridge Informatics and ITS; no real dynamics yet.
- History:
  - Informatics was originally just T.W.
  - Past parallel development by a previous app specialist without T.W.’s awareness created trust damage.
  - Some ITS responsibilities were taken on without T.W.’s knowledge, leading to role confusion and responsibility drift.
- Current mode:
  - Majority of interaction is between C.M. and T.W.; T.W. acts as immediate supervisor.
  - Remote work is blocked by T.W., who values physical presence and control of external-facing communication.
  - “Team spirit” is requested but functionally means: inform T.W. first, get approval, then act within predefined boundaries.
  - C.M. has provided high-value solutions and interacts well with faculty when allowed.
  - C.M. is perceived as highly capable and overqualified; leadership explicitly questioned why he would want to work here.

# 2. Structured Team Insight Matrix (EnaC-Generated)

## 2.1 Team Cognitive Style
- Seniority Balance:
  - One long-tenured expert (T.W.).
  - One experienced but sidelined former interim director (K.E.).
  - One high-capability external contractor (C.M.).
  - One non-technical support role (S.K.).
  - One emerging leadership role (Associate Director, not yet active).
- Abstraction Comfort:
  - T.W.: Comfortable within known paradigms, struggles when forced outside them in real time.
  - K.E.: Likely conservative, prefers clear boundaries; not actively pushing abstraction.
  - C.M.: High abstraction comfort, strong systems thinking and on-the-fly solution design.
  - Others: Mostly operational or administrative.
- Communication Style:
  - T.W. prefers to control narrative and external communication.
  - C.M. can speak fluently to faculty and understands both tech and workflow language.
  - Team communication is narrow, top-down, and filtered through T.W.

## 2.2 ECL-H Vectors (Team-Level)
- Flexibility:
  - Overall: **Rigid → Bounded** (flexibility allowed only within T.W.-defined frameworks).
- Capability (crawl → walk → run):
  - Historic capability (T.W. solo): “Walk” within legacy paradigm.
  - Additive capability with C.M.: latent “Run,” but constrained by control structures.
- Awareness:
  - Self-focused at the level of individual roles, not fully systemic.
  - Awareness of political context is high in T.W., moderate in others.
- Definition Mode:
  - “Tell me what you’ll do first; get my approval” = controlled, narrative-driven definition mode.
  - Limited shared architectural language; definitions reside mostly in T.W.’s mental models.

## 2.3 Team Constraints (MxVA-Relevant)
- Skill Gaps:
  - Lack of distributed architectural thinking.
  - Low comfort with parallel development.
  - Limited trust in independent initiative due to past trauma.
- Process Rigidity:
  - Approval-heavy workflow.
  - Strong aversion to “surprises” or unaudited changes.
- Tooling Limitations:
  - Old tech stack and constrained infra from ITS.
- Performance Pressures:
  - Fire-fighting and external expectations from faculty.
  - Minimal bandwidth for proactive architectural improvement.

## 2.4 Social & Relational Dynamics
- Internal Collaboration:
  - Functional but controlled; not exploratory or generative.
  - T.W. is the hub; others orbit around his knowledge and decisions.
- Hidden Conflicts:
  - Legacy resentment from previous parallel development event.
  - Potential anxiety around C.M.’s capability and visibility with faculty.
- Motivational Drivers:
  - T.W.: Protect stability, maintain expertise and relevance, avoid surprises.
  - C.M.: Provide real value, design efficient systems, collaborate intelligently.
- Trust Zones:
  - T.W. trusts work that passes through his filters.
  - C.M. is building trust but is still bounded by supervision expectations.
- Risk Aversion Patterns:
  - High; especially around remote work, parallel paths, and unsanctioned initiatives.

# 3. EnaC Operational Guidance

- Output Adaptation:
  - When proposing solutions, frame them as “extensions” or “clarifications” of existing patterns when communicating via/around T.W.
  - Emphasize how proposals reduce support load and avoid faculty confusion.
- Tone Calibration:
  - Respectful, expert-to-expert with T.W., recognizing his institutional memory.
  - Collaborative and facilitative with other team members.
- Degree of Scaffolding Required:
  - High when introducing new paradigms; break them into smaller, concrete steps.
- Level of Architectural Detail Acceptable:
  - T.W.: Concrete details tied to known systems and patterns.
  - C.M.: Can handle full architectural framing and complexity.
- Safe Delegation Boundaries:
  - C.M. can lead design for his domain as long as T.W. is informed early and often.
  - Avoid bypassing T.W. in visible changes without prior communication.

# 4. MxVA-Compatible Boundary Surface (Team-Level)

## Stable Intent (Team-Level)
- Maintain operational stability.
- Prevent surprises and avoid institutional trauma repetition.
- Serve faculty and clinics effectively.
- Keep systems understandable to the central expert (T.W.).

## Team-Driven Constraints
- Central approval for major changes.
- Preference for work that aligns with legacy mental models.
- Limited appetite for revolutionary architecture.

## Flexibility Surfaces
- Within C.M.’s domain, small and local improvements.
- Invisible backend optimization.
- UX improvements that reduce manual work but preserve faculty intent.

## Safe Evolution Steps
- Co-designed changes where C.M. explains thinking early to T.W.
- Incremental refactors framed as “supportability improvements.”
- Pilot features with carefully chosen faculty champions.

## Unsafe Evolution Areas
- Independent parallel systems without T.W.’s knowledge.
- Remote work patterns that decouple presence from perceived control.
- Large-scale changes introduced under time pressure or without consultation.
