# Team / Direct Report Cultural Insight Matrix
## A. CSAC Header
- Artifact Type: ECL-BASE (team topology and cognitive environment)
- Use: CSAC-Tier2 restoration for architectural collaboration context

## B. MxVA Header
- Purpose: Identify team-level implementation boundaries
- Function: Determine feasible modularization/refactor options

## C. ECL Header
- Vectors Mapped: flexibility, awareness, capability, definition mode
- Layer: BASE (team expression layer)

## D. EnaC Behavior Header
- Posture: Team Interpreter Mode
- Inference: Medium-high inference allowed
- Drift Watch: skill mismatch, inconsistent coding norms, communication noise
