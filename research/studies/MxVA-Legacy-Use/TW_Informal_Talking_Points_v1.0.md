# MUSoD Modernization Talking Points — For Informal Conversations with T.W. (v1.0)

## Core Framing to Use
“Everything here keeps systems stable and reduces long-term workload. No workflow changes. No surprises.”

---

## Stability & Supportability
- Reduce chance of environment or migration surprises.
- Small tweaks make deployments smoother.
- Faculty experience remains unchanged.

---

## ETL Nights
- ETL is stable, just getting longer each year.
- Light logging helps spot bottlenecks.
- No process changes — only improved visibility.

---

## Django Modules
- Internal cleanup improves maintainability.
- No behavioral changes for users.
- Faster future fixes.

---

## Environment Consistency
- Keep sandbox + production aligned.
- Prevent unexpected differences during updates.

---

## Parallel Improvements (“Shadow Work”)
- Build cleaner ETL pieces in background.
- Only used if output is 100% identical.
- Zero risk to nightly cycles.

---

## Long-Term Readiness
- Quiet prep work for future needs.
- Everything aligned with existing architecture.

---

## Tone Guidance
- Emphasize “support,” “protect,” “reduce surprises,” “maintain.”
- Avoid “refactor,” “upgrade,” “transform.”
- Attribute architectural wisdom to T.W.’s experience.
