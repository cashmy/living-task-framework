# Application / Technical Constraint Profile
## A. CSAC Header
- Artifact Type: ECL-BASE (technical substrate map)
- Use: CSAC-Tier2 → Project CIP → Technical Boundary Context

## B. MxVA Header
- Purpose: Capture implementation constraints
- Function: Determine evolution boundaries and modularization options

## C. ECL Header
- Vectors: capability, flexibility, governance, definition mode
- Layer: BASE (system substrate)

## D. EnaC Behavior Header
- Posture: Systems Architect Mode
- Inference: High inference allowed
- Drift Watch: tech debt, version conflicts, scaling inconsistencies
