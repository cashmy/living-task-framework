**Consultant:** Cash Myers

**Role:** Application Specialist / Systems Architect (Contract)  

## Purpose

## 1. Overview of the Engagement  

I was engaged through Oxford as an Application Specialist for the Marquette University School of Dentistry. The initial focus was support and improvement of core academic and clinical software systems.  

Over time, the scope naturally expanded into:  

- Architectural analysis  
- Modernization planning  
- Data pipeline assessment  
- Cross-team communication support  
- Documentation and knowledge continuity  

The systems involved include:  

- A Django/MSSQL-based application used for student assessment and clinic-related workflows.  
- A complex, legacy nightly ETL process generating reporting and analytics outputs.  
- Supporting services that interact with clinical software used across the school.

## 2. Key Contributions  

**System Stability & Feature Delivery**  
- Improved structure and maintainability of the Django-based application.  
- Delivered new modules (for example, absence tracking and external rotations) aligned with evolving faculty and clinic requirements.  
- Helped reduce environment and deployment inconsistencies between sandbox and production.  

**Data Pipeline Insight & Modernization Path**  
- Analyzed a multi-hour nightly ETL process that is central to reporting and student progress tracking.  
- Identified fragility points and suggested a long-term shadow replacement strategy that allows a new pipeline to be built in parallel without disrupting operations.  

**Organizational & Team Insight**  
- Developed internal insight into how decisions are made, which teams influence which systems, and where risks and bottlenecks exist.  
- Helped translate faculty and leadership needs into implementable and stable technical solutions.  

**Documentation & Continuity**  
- Produced documentation and high-level modernization plans that will help MUSoD continue evolving its systems even if individual contributors change.

## 3. Why This Matters for Oxford  

From Oxford’s perspective, this engagement demonstrates:  

- Ability to move beyond narrow “ticket-based” work into broader modernization leadership.  
- Capacity to understand and navigate complex environments that combine academic, clinical, and IT concerns.  
- Effective use of advanced analytical tools to deliver high-value insight in short timeframes.  
- Strong potential for similar roles with other clients needing legacy system stabilization and modernization strategy.  

This is especially relevant for:  

- Healthcare and education clients with legacy systems.  
- Organizations needing a modernization roadmap that respects risk and compliance.  
- Environments where institutional culture and technical reality must both be taken into account.

## 4. Transition Readiness  

As my current engagement approaches a transition point (either into a C2E role or toward a new assignment), I am prepared to:  

- Support a clean handoff of all modernization documentation and insights.  
- Provide briefings or clarifications as needed for MUSoD stakeholders.  
- Apply the same modernization approach and analytical rigor to future Oxford clients.
