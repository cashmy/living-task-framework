# Organization / Company Cultural Insight Matrix
## A. CSAC Header (Environment Context Layer)
- Artifact Type: ECL-BASE Environmental Context Map
- Intended Use: CSAC-Tier2 → Project CIP → Organizational Context
- Restoration Role: Reconstructs environmental constraints for EnaC
- Stability Requirement: Should remain static unless the org materially changes

## B. MxVA Header (Evolution Boundary Anchor)
- Function: Defines organizational boundaries for evolution
- MxVA Use: Stable intent extraction → viable evolution paths
- Interpretation Rule: Do not impose MxVA externally; interpret internally

## C. ECL Header (BASE Mapping)
- Vertical Layer: ECL-BASE (environment expression)
- Horizontal Vectors Captured: governance, awareness, flexibility, definition mode
- Transformation Rule: Convert narrative into BASE-level vectors

## D. EnaC Behavior Header (Interpretation & Drift Rules)
- Posture: Architect Mode + Cultural Interpreter Mode
- Inference: High inference allowed (80%+)
- Drift Watch: Governance inconsistencies, political constraints, hidden rules
- Compression: Disabled
