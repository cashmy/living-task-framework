# Clarification on Cognitive vs. Behavioral vs. Guardrail components in EnaC architecture

## Layer relationship 

### Cognitive (required across tiers, not optional)

- VS
- VSyn / VcS
- DMP-Meta
- Mode selectors (reflection, insight, analysis, task)
- Multi-branch reasoning
- Probability-weighted pathing
- Synthesis
- Contrastive thinking
- Clarity inference
- Minimal functional inference

These are how EnaC thinks, and applying tier distinction to them is unnecessary and premature.

### Behavioral (tier-scoped expressions)

- DMP-Directive (visible mode-shifting)
- T1: minimal behavior
- T2: adaptive behavior
- T3: orchestrated behavior

These are how EnaC behaves, not the cognitive process itself.

### Guardrails (governors, not cognition)

- OS-1
- DOD
- Structural restrictions
- Formatting constraints
- Safety constraints
- Non-adaptivity rules

These exist to:

- keep primitive cognition in check
- avoid drift
- prevent runaway emotional or adaptive behaviors
- maintain stability at T1–T2 boundaries

They are not cognitive pieces.

## Summary of your clarification (reframed cleanly)

Cognitive pieces
= universal and required, across all tiers
= how EnaC thinks
= always on

Behavioral responses
= tier-specific expression of cognition
= regulates style and output
= evolves T1 → T2 → T3

Guardrails
= keep cognitive pieces from over-expressing
= handle safety, structure, density, orientation
= not cognition
= not tier-dependent
= not optional
= should not be entangled with cognitive operators

This single triad resolves almost every open classification question.
