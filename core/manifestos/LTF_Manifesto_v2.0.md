# LTF Manifesto v2.0  
## Living Task Framework — The Semantic Evolution Engine of UCS

### 1. Identity Statement

The **Living Task Framework (LTF)** is the evolutionary heart of the Unified Cognition Stack (UCS).

> LTF is the system that takes structured meaning  
> and turns it into evolving context,  
> relational structure,  
> actionable tasks,  
> and long-term semantic lineage.

EchoForge captures raw cognition.  
GlossRP anchors meaning.  
SCS compiles meaning.  
**LTF evolves meaning.**

LTF is the **semantic graph**, the **lineage map**, and the **task engine** that ensures ideas do not die—they mature.

### 2. Why LTF Must Exist

Without LTF:

- ideas remain static, isolated artifacts  
- no semantic relationships form  
- no lineage is stored  
- drift is invisible  
- evolution is accidental  
- nothing integrates across time  

LTF ensures that:

- ideas become tasks,  
- tasks become nodes in a semantic graph,  
- nodes evolve into systems,  
- systems gain lineage,  
- lineage becomes navigable and usable.

LTF is how cognition becomes structure.

### 3. Core Principles

1. **Ideas Become Tasks**  
   Every concept can instantiate as a tracked, evolving unit of work.

2. **Relationships Drive Meaning**  
   A concept is not defined only by what it *is*, but by what it *connects to*.

3. **Evolution is the Default State**  
   Every modification, refinement, or contextual shift is logged as evolution, not replacement.

4. **Drift Is Not Failure**  
   Drift marks growth, change, reinterpretation, or misalignment.  
   LTF tracks all four.

5. **Meaning Has Lineage**  
   Ideas carry ancestry and descendants. No concept exists in isolation.

6. **The Semantic Graph Is Alive**  
   Nodes evolve, split, merge, and reorganize based on new insights.

7. **Human + AI Co-Evolution**  
   LTF structures emerge from human insights, AI synthesis, or both.

### 4. What LTF Does

1. **Task Node Creation**  
   Codifies ideas as actionable, referenceable units.

2. **Semantic Relationship Engine**  
   Creates, updates, and queries concept-to-concept links.

3. **Temporal Evolution Objects (TEOs)**  
   Records lineage, drift, and semantic evolution.

4. **Relationship Typing**  
   Includes:
   - depends_on  
   - informs  
   - evolves_from  
   - alternative_of  
   - part_of  
   - conflicts_with  
   - supersedes  
   - supports

5. **Semantic Graph Management**  
   LTF becomes the long-term memory for all projects, concepts, and artifacts.

6. **Classification & Grouping**  
   Groups artifacts using:
   - concept,
   - tool,
   - framework,
   - project,
   - lineage,
   - TEO events.

7. **Integration Hub**  
   Enables seamless integration with:
   - Phoenix Workbench,
   - EchoForge,
   - SCS,
   - GlossRP,
   - external productivity tools.

### 5. What LTF Does *Not* Do

LTF does not:

- interpret raw cognition (EchoForge does)
- retrieve TermSpecs (GlossRP does)
- compile meaning (SCS does)
- generate artifacts (PW does)
- perform Tier reasoning (SCS does)
- execute code or manage LLM lanes (PW does)

LTF is the **semantic backbone**, not the UX or compiler.

---

### 6. Relationship to UCS Components

**EchoForge → LTF**  
- EF sends summaries, classification, and validated intent to LTF.

**GlossRP → LTF**  
- LTF receives TermSpec bundles for mapping and grouping.

**SCS → LTF**  
- LTF consumes compiled semantic slices as relational anchors.

**PW ↔ LTF**  
- PW displays LTF’s task graph and organizes artifacts by LTF mappings.

---

### 7. ECL Alignment

**BASE:** LTF establishes identity and stable conceptual anchors.  
**CORE:** LTF governs behavior through tasks and relationships.  
**SKY:** LTF reveals evolution, lineage, and strategic coherence.

LTF is the embodiment of ECL’s upward motion:  
from identity → behavior → purpose → evolution.

---

### 8. Closing Declaration

LTF is the system that ensures ideas do not merely exist—they *evolve*.  
It gives continuity, causality, and structure to everything within the UCS.

> LTF is the beating heart of meaning.  
> Where concepts live, grow, and become real.
