## 0. Identity  

- **System Name:**  
- **Abbreviation (if any):**  
- **Domain(s):** (e.g., UCS-Core / PW / EnaC / ECL-BASE/CORE/SKY)  
- **Current Version / Stage:** (e.g., Concept, Prototype, v1.0)  

---

## 1. Purpose & Intent  

### 1.1 Why This System Exists  
- What core problem(s) does this system address?  
- What pain, confusion, or cost does it remove?  

### 1.2 Intended Outcomes  
- What does “success” look like for this system?  
- Who benefits and how?

## 2. System Scope  

### 2.1 In-Scope  
- Core capabilities the system **will** provide.  

### 2.2 Out-of-Scope  
- Capabilities the system **explicitly will not** provide.  
- Neighboring domains handled by other systems.  

### 2.3 System Boundaries  
- Interfaces to other systems, tools, or frameworks.  

---

## 3. Principles & Governance  

### 3.1 Design Principles  
- Guiding principles for architecture, behavior, and evolution.  

### 3.2 Governance Rules  
- Who decides changes?  
- What requires human approval?  
- How are breaking changes managed?  

### 3.3 ECL Alignment  
- How this system relates to ECL-BASE, ECL-CORE, and ECL-SKY.

### 4.3 Interoperability Rules  
- Constraints on how others must integrate with this system.  

---

## 5. Behavioral Expectations  

### 5.1 System Behaviors  
- Key behavioral properties (consistency, latency, reliability, etc.).  

### 5.2 Failure Modes  
- Expected failure patterns and how they should be handled.  

### 5.3 Human Interaction
