# Architecture Manifesto Template  
## Version: v1.0.0  

> Template for: **Architecture Manifesto**  
> Scope: Large-scale architectural models (e.g., Spin-Up Architecture, SAAS-Node Network Architecture).

---

## 0. Identity  

- **Architecture Name:**  
- **Abbreviation (if any):**  
- **Domain(s):** (e.g., UCS-Core / PW / EnaC / Infra)  
- **Primary Context:** (e.g., PW orchestration, multi-agent systems, data plane)  

---

## 1. Architectural Intent  

### 1.1 Core Architectural Problem  
- What structural problem does this architecture solve?  

### 1.2 Design Goals  
- What goals drive this architecture? (e.g., modularity, resilience, interpretability, evolvability)  

### 1.3 Non-Goals  
- Design goals explicitly **not** pursued by this architecture.  

---

## 2. Structural Doctrine  

### 2.1 Core Components  
- What are the main components / nodes / layers?  

### 2.2 Interaction Patterns  
- How do components interact (sync/async, event-driven, SAAS-style, etc.)?  

### 2.3 Layering Model  
- How does this architecture layer or segment responsibilities?  

---

## 3. Constraints & Boundaries  

### 3.1 Allowed Patterns  
- Patterns that are encouraged or preferred.  

### 3.2 Forbidden Patterns  
- Patterns that violate the architecture’s intent.  

### 3.3 ECL Alignment  
- How this architecture maps to ECL-BASE / ECL-CORE / ECL-SKY.  

---

## 4. Integration & Compatibility  

### 4.1 Intended Integration Targets  
- Systems / frameworks this architecture is designed to host or coordinate.  

### 4.2 Compatibility Rules  
- Constraints on how other components must adapt to fit this architecture.  

### 4.3 Migration Paths  
- How existing systems may migrate into this architecture.  

---

## 5. Evolution & Resilience  

### 5.1 Stability Guarantees  
- What aspects are stable and should not change lightly?  

### 5.2 Evolvable Areas  
- What parts are designed for flexibility or replacement?  

### 5.3 Failure Containment  
- How failures should be isolated and contained structurally.  

---

## 6. Human & AI Collaboration  

### 6.1 Role of Human Architects  
- What decisions must remain human-driven?  

### 6.2 Role of AI Agents  
- What architectural reasoning can AI assist or automate?  

### 6.3 Governance Mechanisms  
- How conflicts or trade-offs are resolved.
