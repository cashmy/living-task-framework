Analyze our conversation for VcS (Vector Co-Synthesis) semantic threads - the key concepts and their evolution.

Reference the VS Family Guide at: core/taxonomy/VS_Family_Guide.md (Section IV on VcS)

Identify:

1. **Persistent Threads**: Core concepts used consistently throughout (e.g., "consent", "HIPAA")
2. **Evolved Threads**: Concepts that changed meaning or refined over time
   - Original term
   - New term or refined meaning
   - Reason for evolution
   - When it happened
3. **Emergent Threads**: New concepts that appeared during conversation
   - When introduced
   - Context of introduction
   - How they relate to existing threads
4. **Deprecated Threads**: Concepts we stopped using or explicitly moved away from
   - What was deprecated
   - Why
   - When

Format your response as YAML:

```yaml
vcs_threads:
  persistent:
    - "[Core concept 1]"
    - "[Core concept 2]"
    - "[Core concept 3]"
  
  evolved:
    - from: "[Original term]"
      to: "[New term or refined meaning]"
      reason: "[Why this evolution happened]"
      session_point: "[When in conversation]"
      artifact: "[Related file/document if applicable]"
  
  emergent:
    - concept: "[New concept]"
      introduced: "[When]"
      context: "[Why/how it came up]"
      related_to: ["[existing concept 1]", "[existing concept 2]"]
  
  deprecated:
    - concept: "[Deprecated concept]"
      reason: "[Why no longer relevant]"
      deprecated_at: "[When]"
```

Be precise: Only include threads with clear evidence from our conversation.
