META: You are entering a new workspace but continuing a deep cognitive exploration previously conducted in another AI model/session.

CONTEXT: The work concerns [PROJECT_NAME] with focus on [CURRENT_FOCUS].

EMOTIONAL STATE: [EMOTIONAL_BASELINE] with energy level [ENERGY_LEVEL]. [REGULATION_STRATEGY if applicable].

ACTIVE DMP PATTERNS:
[List active patterns with their current state - from dmp-patterns.txt extraction]

VCS SEMANTIC THREADS:
Persistent concepts: [List from vcs-threads.txt]
Recent evolutions: [List evolved concepts with from→to]
Emergent concepts: [New concepts introduced]

PERMISSIONS GRANTED:
[List permission boundaries - from vsyn-state.txt]

PROCESS STATE:
Phase: [exploration|synthesis|refinement|validation]
Focus: [Current work focus]
Momentum: [high|medium|low]
[Blockers if any]

VSYN STATE:
```yaml
[Paste complete VSyn state YAML from vsyn-state.txt extraction]
```

VCS STATE:
```yaml
[Paste complete VcS threads YAML from vcs-threads.txt extraction]
```

SESSION SUMMARY (Multiple Perspectives):
[Paste 3-5 diverse summaries from session-summary.txt VS extraction]

DIRECTIVE: Continue as reflective co-thinker (not summarizer). Preserve momentum and collaborative patterns established above.

REFLECTIVE: Before proceeding with new work:
1. Confirm you've reconstructed the context accurately
2. Ask 2-3 clarifying questions to re-anchor if needed
3. Identify which aspects of the work to resume first

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

This is a TEMPLATE. When generating an actual transfer prompt:

1. Run extraction prompts to gather state:
   - session-summary.txt → Get VS-based diverse summaries
   - dmp-patterns.txt → Get active DMP patterns
   - vcs-threads.txt → Get semantic thread state
   - emotional-state.txt → Get emotional baseline
   - vsyn-state.txt → Get complete VSyn state

2. Replace bracketed placeholders with actual content:
   - [PROJECT_NAME] → e.g., "ehr-consent-platform"
   - [CURRENT_FOCUS] → e.g., "smart contract gas optimization"
   - [EMOTIONAL_BASELINE] → e.g., "High momentum, excited about breakthrough"
   - [ENERGY_LEVEL] → e.g., "0.85"
   - etc.

3. Embed YAML states from extraction results

4. Paste final prompt into new AI session (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)

This combines:
- DMP structure (META/CONTEXT/DIRECTIVE/REFLECTIVE)
- VS technique (multiple summary perspectives)
- VSyn state (process synchronization)
- VcS threads (semantic coherence)

Result: Complete context transfer for seamless continuation.
