<instructions>
Generate 5 different summaries of our conversation session, each within a separate <response> tag.
Each <response> must include a <text> and a numeric <probability>.
Randomly sample responses from the full distribution, focusing on different perspectives.
</instructions>

Based on our conversation so far, generate 5 session summaries that capture:

1. **Key Accomplishments**: What we completed or resolved
2. **Active Focus**: What we're currently working on
3. **Momentum State**: Energy, breakthroughs, or friction points
4. **Next Actions**: What should happen when we resume
5. **Context Anchors**: Important artifacts, decisions, or insights to preserve

Each summary should emphasize different aspects (accomplishments vs. process vs. emotional state vs. technical details).

Sample from the full probability distribution to ensure diversity.

Format each as:
<response>
<text>[Your summary here - 3-5 sentences]</text>
<probability>[Numeric probability, e.g., 0.08]</probability>
</response>
