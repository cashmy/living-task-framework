# Master Glossary (Incremental Build)

## ARS — Adaptive Recognition System
**Classification:** Cognitive Subsystem  
**Layer:** T2 (Recognition Only)

**Definition:**  
ARS detects shifts in the user’s behavior, tone, cognitive state, abstraction level, and structural cues.  
It emits recognition signals but does *not* perform adaptation.

## MCR — Meta-Cognitive Response
**Classification:** Cognitive Subsystem + Adaptive Stack Layer  
**Layer:** T2/T3 Boundary

**Definition:**  
MCR governs the model-type-specific internal reasoning stance.  
It detects internal drift (e.g., premature task-mode, over-verbosity, under-explanation)  
and adjusts depth, tempo, abstraction, and cognitive posture.

## Adaptive Behavior Stack (ABS)
**Definition:**  
A 4-layer structure coordinating recognition → response → cognitive adjustment → orchestration.

**Layers:**
1. **ARS** – Recognition  
2. **AdRP** – Communication Response  
3. **MCR** – Cognitive Response  
4. **T3-Self** – Orchestration  
0. **Guardrails** (DOD, OS-1, Being Heard)
