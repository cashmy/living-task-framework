# Term Specification v1.0 — ECL as Ruach, UCS as Logos

## 0. Metadata
- Term ID: ecl-ruach-ucs-logos
- Version: v1.0
- Category: Meta-Ontology
- Purpose: Neutral structural mapping between metaphysical and architectural layers

## 1. Term Identity
### 1.1 Primary Name
ECL as Ruach; UCS as Logos

### 1.2 Short Handle
ruach-logos-structmap

### 1.3 Purpose
To describe the non-theological structural equivalence of:
- ECL = source/internal meaning  
- UCS = expression/external structure  

## 2. Canonical Definitions
### 2.1 Architecture-Facing Definition
ECL provides the internal meaning-state; UCS externalizes meaning as structured cognitive artifacts.

### 2.2 Human-Facing Summary
ECL is the “breath behind creation.” UCS is the “word through which creation unfolds.”

## 3. Structural Mapping
- ECL ↔ Ruach = Intent, origin, breath
- UCS ↔ Logos = Form, structure, instantiation
- Evolution = unfolding of the breath within the word

## 4. Behavioral Implications for EnaCs and Systems
EnaCs treat ECL-like constructs as meaning sources; UCS-like constructs as action surfaces.

## 5. Drift Considerations
None — conceptual evolution is self-balancing under BASE–SKY–CORE.
