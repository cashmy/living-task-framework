## Version 1.0  
## Status: Active (Generated via Term_Spec_Template_v1.0)

---

# 1. Term Name  
**ECL_BASE — Evolutionary Context Layer — BASE**

---

# 2. Purpose  
To anchor cognition into feasible, concrete, actionable reality.

---

# 3. Definition  
BASE is the execution layer of ECL responsible for operational grounding, feasibility, and practical constraints.

---

# 4. Contextual Alignment  

## 4.1 ECL Alignment  
- SKY: indirect
- CORE: upstream
- BASE: primary

## 4.2 PHCS Lane Involvement  
Primarily L6 (Constraint), L3 (Error-Check).

## 4.3 MxVA Vector Touchpoints  
Risk, Practicality, Temporal Feasibility.

---

# 5. Structural Components  
- Feasibility engine
- Constraint application filters
- Action gating mechanisms

---

# 6. Behavioral Rules  
- BASE MUST validate feasibility.
- BASE MUST NOT redefine SKY.
- BASE SHOULD run post-CORE integration.

---

# 7. Interaction Surfaces  
- SCC constraint execution
- Messaging Fabric META messages
- SAAS BASE-mode task execution

---

# 8. Example Invocation  
- Constraining a design before coding.
- Rejecting paths that violate reality constraints.

---

# 9. Non-Examples & Misuse Cases  
- Allowing BASE to set purpose.
- Using BASE to prematurely narrow exploration.

---

# 10. Related Terms  
ECL, CORE, SKY, SCC, PHCS
