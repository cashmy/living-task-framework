## Version 1.0  
## Status: Active (Generated via Term_Spec_Template_v1.0)

---

# 1. Term Name  
**ECL_CORE — Evolutionary Context Layer — CORE**

---

# 2. Purpose  
To perform the integrative cognitive processing that transforms SKY intent into coherent, structured reasoning.

---

# 3. Definition  
CORE is the central reasoning layer responsible for synthesis, analysis, patterning, and conceptual integration.

---

# 4. Contextual Alignment  

## 4.1 ECL Alignment  
- SKY: upstream
- CORE: primary
- BASE: downstream

## 4.2 PHCS Lane Involvement  
L1, L2, L3, L5 depending on reasoning task.

## 4.3 MxVA Vector Touchpoints  
Cognitive, Structural, Organizational Vectors.

---

# 5. Structural Components  
- Integration engine
- Reasoning architecture
- Pattern and synthesis channels

---

# 6. Behavioral Rules  
- CORE MUST interpret SKY intent.
- CORE SHOULD structure output for BASE.
- CORE MUST NOT overtake SKY direction.

---

# 7. Interaction Surfaces  
- PHCS multi-lane integration
- SAAS role-switching
- SCC logic evaluation

---

# 8. Example Invocation  
- Synthesizing an architecture.
- Evaluating multiple reasoning lanes.

---

# 9. Non-Examples & Misuse Cases  
- Allowing CORE to redefine SKY.
- Overusing L5 leading to runaway branch generation.

---

# 10. Related Terms  
ECL, SKY, BASE, PHCS, SAAS
