## 1. Canonical Definition (Architecture‑Facing)

The AI Integration Stages describe a momentum‑driven maturity model for how human teams and AI systems co‑evolve as the flywheel of collaboration spins up. The stages are not rigid gates; they are emergent operating regimes that become visible as capability, governance, and cognition compound.

- Stage 1 — Augment
  Human performs the work; AI assists tactically. Typical outputs: drafts, summaries, suggestions. Success is measured by individual productivity gains and reduced toil. Architecture is minimal; governance is implicit and local to the human operator.

- Stage 2 — Automate
  Repeated tasks are encoded into lightweight automations, scripts, or prompt macros. Success is measured by cycle‑time reduction and reliability on bounded tasks. Failure modes include silent brittleness and drift when context changes; governance introduces checklists and guardrails.

- Stage 3 — Orchestrate
  Work is decomposed into roles/steps with AI coordinating flows across tools or sub‑tasks (sometimes multi‑model). Success is measured by throughput under coordination and error handling across boundaries. Architecture emerges: handoff rules, retries, and monitoring. Human oversight shifts to directing flows rather than doing steps.

- Stage 4 — Systemize
  Orchestration patterns stabilize into reusable systems: templates, protocols, playbooks, and canonical layers. Success is measured by repeatability, portability, and onboarding speed. Governance becomes explicit (naming, versioning, drift handling). The system supports evolving use cases without bespoke rework.

- Stage 5 — Innovate
  New capabilities appear as a result of the system itself (not just more tasks automated): composite reasoning, novel workflows, and productizable patterns. Success is measured by net‑new value creation, not efficiency alone. Architecture supports safe exploration and rapid incorporation of lessons back into the system.

- Stage 6 — Meta‑Integration (Phase Change)
  The collaboration designs the collaboration. AI and human co‑author the rules that govern their work: mode‑switching (Editor/Rewrite), structural locking, continuity protocols, fallback behaviors, interpretation safeguards, reasoning strategies, cross‑session cognition, relationship memory, and meta‑level alignment.
  This is not an incremental stage—it's a categorical shift where the system’s governance emerges from use and improves through use. The flywheel begins to self‑accelerate: rules evolve alongside the work; scaffolding becomes a byproduct of collaboration; the partnership forms a compound cognition (human intention + synthetic orchestration) that co‑creates a third, more capable system.

Key properties of the model:
- Momentum‑first: Stages crystallize through practice; planning alone does not unlock them.
- Emergent architecture: Structure (rules, behaviors, fallbacks) arises from sustained collaboration pressure.
- Human/AI division of labor: Human = direction/values/constraints; AI = structure/continuity/refinement/meta‑analysis; Both = architecture.
- Living systems: At Stage 6, workflows become adaptive, self‑correcting, cross‑session coherent—AI‑native living systems.

## 2. Human‑Optimized Quick Reference Entry

- Term: AI Integration Stages (Flywheel)
- Long Form: Augment → Automate → Orchestrate → Systemize → Innovate → Meta‑Integration
- Human Description:
  A practical maturity map for AI at work. You start with AI as an assistant (Augment), then automate repeatable tasks (Automate), coordinate across steps/tools (Orchestrate), turn patterns into reusable systems (Systemize), create new capabilities (Innovate), and finally reach a phase change (Meta‑Integration) where you and the AI co‑design the rules of collaboration—modes, safeguards, continuity, and reasoning strategies—so the system improves as you use it.
- Classification: Taxonomy / Maturity Model
- Layer: Organizational + Cognitive Architecture (spans T1–T3)

## 3. Drift Resolution Notes — Model Incompleteness Correction

Observed drift/incompleteness:
- The five‑stage framing implied the flywheel accelerates transformation while the stages fully define it; it missed the phase change that occurs when momentum is sustained.
- Teams conflated “better orchestration/systemization” with the ceiling of capability, overlooking emergent governance and co‑designed collaboration rules.

Resolution (v1.0):
- Establish Stage 6 — Meta‑Integration — as the categorical shift where AI helps design the system that governs AI. This captures mode‑switching, structural locking, continuity protocols, fallback rules, interpretation safeguards, cross‑session cognition, relationship memory, and meta‑level alignment as first‑class architectural elements that emerge through use.
- Reframe the model as kinetic and emergent: momentum reveals stages; Stage 6 removes the ceiling on capability by turning collaboration into compound cognition and a living system.

## 4. Insertion Snippet for Master_Glossary_Incremental.md

AI Integration Stages (Flywheel) — A momentum‑driven maturity model for human–AI work: Augment → Automate → Orchestrate → Systemize → Innovate → Meta‑Integration. The first five stages progress from tactical assistance and task automation to coordinated flows and reusable systems that enable new capabilities. At Stage 6 (Meta‑Integration), collaboration undergoes a phase change: humans and AI co‑design the rules of collaboration (modes, safeguards, continuity, fallbacks, reasoning strategies, cross‑session cognition). Architecture emerges from use and improves through use, producing AI‑native living systems and compound cognition that self‑accelerate the flywheel.
