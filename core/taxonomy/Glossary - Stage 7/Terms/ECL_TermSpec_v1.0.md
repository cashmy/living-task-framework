# 1. Term Name  
**ECL — Evolutionary Context Layering**

---

# 2. Purpose  
To provide a tri-layer cognitive alignment system (SKY–CORE–BASE) that governs meaning, reasoning, and execution across PHCS, SAAS networks, SCC contracts, and HOMSP cognition.

---

# 3. Definition  
ECL is the three-tiered system of human–AI contextual alignment ensuring direction (SKY), integration (CORE), and action feasibility (BASE).

---

# 4. Contextual Alignment  

## 4.1 ECL Alignment  
- SKY: full
- CORE: full
- BASE: full

## 4.2 PHCS Lane Involvement  
L1–L6 depending on SKY/CORE/BASE engagement patterns.

## 4.3 MxVA Vector Touchpoints  
Meaning (SKY), Cognitive (CORE), Practical/Risk (BASE).

---

# 5. Structural Components  
- SKY Layer
- CORE Layer
- BASE Layer
- Alignment channels
- Cross-layer binding rules

---

# 6. Behavioral Rules  
- Layers MUST remain distinct.
- SKY MUST govern CORE.
- CORE MUST filter BASE.
- BASE MUST ground execution feasibility.

---

# 7. Interaction Surfaces  
- HOMSP identity anchoring
- SAAS node intent alignment
- SCC enforcement
- PHCS lane activation rules

---

# 8. Example Invocation  
- Using SKY to reset direction.
- Using CORE for integration of complex reasoning.

---

# 9. Non-Examples & Misuse Cases  
- Using BASE to override SKY.
- Attempting execution without CORE coherence.

---

# 10. Related Terms  
SKY, CORE, BASE, PHCS, SAAS, SCC
