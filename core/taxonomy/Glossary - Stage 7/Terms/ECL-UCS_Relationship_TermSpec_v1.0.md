# ECL–UCS Relationship — Term Specification v1.0

## 0. Metadata
- **Term ID:** ecl-ucs-rel
- **Version:** v1.0
- **Status:** Draft
- **Steward:** Cash Myers / EnaC
- **Domain:** Meta-Framework
- **Scope Notes:** Defines the formal relationship between Evolutionary Context Layering (ECL) and the Unified Cognition Stack (UCS).

## 1. Term Identity
### 1.1 Primary Name
- **Name:** ECL–UCS Relationship
- **Acronym:** ECL↔UCS
- **Short Handle:** ecl-ucs-rel

### 1.2 Concise Purpose
Defines how internal meaning evolution (ECL) interfaces with the external cognitive system (UCS).

## 2. Canonical Definitions
### 2.1 Architecture-Facing Definition
ECL provides the ontological framework for how meaning evolves; UCS implements that evolution through structured artifacts, EnaCs, and tool workflows. Together they form a closed-loop cognitive architecture.

### 2.2 Human-Facing Summary
ECL models your personal growth and meaning. UCS turns that meaning into tools, tasks, and real outputs.

### 2.3 SCS-T1 Anchor
ECL evolves you; UCS evolves your ideas.

## 3. Subsystem Views
### 3.1 EnaC Perspective
EnaCs treat ECL as the semantic grounding layer and UCS as the execution environment.

### 3.2 SELF-ECL Perspective
SELF-ECL uses UCS outputs as reflective anchors for further internal evolution.

### 3.3 ABS / ARS / Meaning-Weight
Drift and recognition engines rely on ECL for meaning and UCS for structure.

## 4. Behavioral Implications
### 4.1 When This Term Matters
Whenever meaning must be converted into structured cognitive action.

### 4.2 Failure Modes
- Treating ECL as a tool rather than an ontology  
- Treating UCS as a fixed/static system  

### 4.3 Observable Signals
- Strong alignment between intent and artifacts  
- Smooth recursive cognitive cycles  

## 5. Historical / Evolution
### 5.1 Origin Context
Created to capture the meta-relationship between the internal meaning engine and the external cognition system.

### 5.2 Revision History
- v1.0 — Initial specification

## 6. References
- Term_Spec_Template_v1.0.md  
- ECL Manifesto  
- USC System Overview

## 7. RDP / Safety Notes
- **Allowed:** Expansion into new EnaC classes  
- **Forbidden:** Collapsing ECL into UCS
