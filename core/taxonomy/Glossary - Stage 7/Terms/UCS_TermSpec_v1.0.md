# UCS — Unified Cognition System  
## Term Specification v1.0  
## Status: Active (Renamed from “Unified Cognition” per architectural correction)

---

# 1. Term Name  
**UCS — Unified Cognition System**

---

# 2. Purpose  
UCS defines the *system-level architecture* for hybrid human–AI cognition.  
It operationalizes “Unified Cognition” into a structured, layered subsystem that integrates:

- Human intentionality (SKY)  
- HOMSP hybridization  
- PHCS multi-lane cognition  
- SAAS agentic execution  
- SAAS Network distributed reasoning  
- SCC governance and safety mechanisms  

UCS is the **functional engine** enabling full-spectrum hybrid cognition.

---

# 3. Definition  
The **Unified Cognition System (UCS)** is the complete cognitive architecture formed when:

1. a human provides SKY-level purpose  
2. HOMSP binds human + AI cognition into a coordinated organism  
3. PHCS supplies multi-lane reasoning  
4. SAAS executes agentic cognition  
5. The SAAS Network provides distributed intelligence  
6. SCC governs system-wide safety and coherence  

UCS is the *actual subsystem* implementing the conceptual model of Unified Cognition.

# 4. Contextual Alignment  

## 4.1 ECL Alignment  
- **SKY:** establishes top-level purpose and identity  
- **CORE:** integrates PHCS reasoning with SAAS roles  
- **BASE:** grounds execution feasibility and safety  

## 4.2 PHCS Lane Involvement  
UCS uses all PHCS lanes (L1–L6) depending on cognitive task, with coordinated multi-lane activation across human + AI.

## 4.3 MxVA Vector Touchpoints  
- Meaning (SKY)  
- Cognitive (CORE)  
- Risk/Practicality (BASE)  
- Temporal, Organizational, Experiential vectors

# 6. Behavioral Rules  
- The **Human (SKY)** MUST remain sovereign.  
- **HOMSP** MUST integrate reasoning without identity confusion.  
- **PHCS lanes** MUST be properly separated and governed.  
- **SAAS** MUST behave as a unified agent internally.  
- **SAAS Network** MUST maintain consistency via Messaging Fabric.  
- **SCC** MUST enforce constraints and prevent unsafe drift.  
- **BASE layer** MUST NOT prematurely narrow SKY/CORE exploration.  
- **Failure modes** MUST invoke the HOMSP Rest Protocol.

# 8. Example Invocation  

### Example A — Full-System Architecture Cycle  
1. Human: SKY intent sets direction  
2. HOMSP: Hybrid mode activates  
3. PHCS: L1-L2-L3 reasoning  
4. SAAS: Single-agent execution  
5. SAAS Network: Distributed refinement  
6. SCC: Contract validation  
7. UCS produces aligned output  

### Example B — Risk-State Correction  
- L5 divergence spike detected  
- L6 applies constraints  
- SCC flags drift  
- SKY reasserts purpose  
- UCS returns to stable alignment

# 9. Non-Examples & Misuse Cases  
- Treating UCS as “AI-only”  
- Allowing AI to override SKY  
- Using PHCS lanes as independent agents  
- Overusing L5 without L6 constraints  
- Running hybrid cognition without SCC governance
