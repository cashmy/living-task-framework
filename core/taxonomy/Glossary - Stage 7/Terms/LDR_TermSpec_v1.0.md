# Long-Distance Relationship (Narrow Cognitive Sense) — Term Specification v1.0

## 0. Metadata
- **Term ID:** long-dist-rel
- **Version:** v1.0
- **Status:** Draft
- **Last Updated:** 2025-11-22
- **Steward:** Cash Myers / EnaC
- **Domain:** Pattern
- **Scope Notes:** Non-local cognitive connection between distant concepts that share high personal or creative meaning but little semantic overlap.

## 1. Term Identity

### 1.1 Primary Name
- **Name:** Long-Distance Relationship (Narrow Cognitive Sense)
- **Acronym:** LDR
- **Short Handle:** long-dist-rel

### 1.2 Concise Purpose
A non-local relationship between distant concepts that are meaningfully linked in cognition despite low semantic or categorical similarity.

## 2. Canonical Definitions

### 2.1 Architecture-Facing Definition
In the narrow LTF sense, a Long-Distance Relationship (LDR) is an edge between nodes that occupy distant positions in semantic space yet exhibit high meaning-weight and cognitive relevance. LDRs often emerge from analogy, narrative, or subconscious integration and are treated as first-class signals.

### 2.2 Human-Facing Summary
LDRs are the “weird but right” connections your mind makes between things that don’t logically go together but clearly belong together for you.

### 2.3 SCS-T1 Anchor (≤ 25 words)
A high-meaning, non-local connection between distant concepts that the system treats as a deliberate, first-class relationship.

## 3. Subsystem Views (Optional)

### 3.1 EnaC Perspective
EnaC uses LDRs as prompts for creative exploration, hypothesis generation, and non-linear solution paths in design or strategy.

### 3.2 SELF-ECL Perspective
For SELF-ECL, LDRs mirror liminal insight—those sudden cross-topic jumps that reveal deeper patterns in your own evolution.

### 3.3 ABS / ARS / Meaning-Weight Interactions
ABS regards LDRs as special-case behavior shapers, while ARS uses LDR tagging to distinguish creative leaps from noise.

### 3.4 Other Subsystems
None currently specified.

## 4. Behavioral Implications

### 4.1 When This Term Matters
LDR matters when modeling ideation, EchoForge captures, and any work where non-obvious links often produce the most valuable breakthroughs.

### 4.2 Failure Modes
Without LDR, the system flattens or discards important creative links, forcing everything into local similarity and losing deep insight.

### 4.3 Observable Signals
Connections that feel surprising yet repeatedly useful, often crossing topics, domains, or time periods in ways that clarify rather than confuse.

## 5. Historical / Evolution (Optional)

### 5.1 Origin Context
Formalized to preserve and systematize the kind of liminal, non-linear insight that typical information architectures cannot represent.

### 5.2 Revision History
- v1.0 — Initial term specification draft generated via SCS-aligned template.

### 5.3 Deprecated Meanings
None at this time.

## 6. References

### 6.1 Primary Sources
- Term_Spec_Template_v1.0.md

### 6.2 Secondary Sources
- SCS_TermSpec_v1.0.md

### 6.3 External Influences (Optional)
None explicitly captured.

## 7. RDP / Safety Notes

- **Allowed Refactors:** Refine detection heuristics; add stronger integration with EchoForge capture pipelines.
- **Forbidden Refactors:** Using LDR tagging for generic weak associations; diluting the distinction between LDR and ordinary semantic similarity.
- **Additional Notes:** Term governance should be coordinated with LTF and EnaC evolution planning.
