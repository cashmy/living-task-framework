# Term Specification: Manifesto  
**ID:** manifesto  
**Primary Name:** Manifesto  
**Acronym:** MFST  
**Domain:** UCS-Core / EnaC / PW / ECL  
**Status:** Active  
**Version:** v1.0.0  

---

## 1. Human Summary  
In the UCS/EnaC ecosystem, a **Manifesto** is a formal, declarative document that captures the *philosophy, intent, principles, and governance logic* behind a framework, protocol, subsystem, or architectural pattern.  
Unlike its broad use in human culture, where “manifesto” may imply activism, ideology, or public persuasion, the UCS meaning is **narrow, structured, and functional**:

> *A Manifesto defines why something exists, what principles guide its evolution, and what boundaries govern its use.*

Manifestos establish conceptual clarity, philosophical anchors, and long-term stability for complex cognitive systems.

## 2. Architecture Summary  
A Manifesto operates primarily at the **ECL-SKY** and **ECL-CORE** levels.  
It does not define mechanics or implementation details; instead, it provides:

- **Intent:** Why the system or concept exists  
- **Principles:** What governs its behavior  
- **Boundaries:** What it must not become  
- **Interpretation Rules:** How it relates to other frameworks  
- **Evolution Path:** How it should grow without drift  

Manifestos act as “North Stars” for frameworks and systems, ensuring that architectural decisions align with the original purpose.

Manifestos are not specifications, protocols, or term definitions—they govern them.

## 4. Metadata  
- **Origin:** Evolved from the creation of MxVA, ECL, GlossRP, PW, STMG, and SLA documents  
- **Purpose:** Provide philosophical anchoring and top-level governance  
- **Variants:** Multiple manifesto subtypes (see below)  
- **Related Terms:** TermSpec, Protocol, Architecture Spec, Invariants, RoleSpec  
- **Suspected Drift:** false (stable and intentionally slow-changing)

## 5. Types of Manifestos in the UCS Ecosystem  

### 5.1 **Framework Manifesto**  
Defines purpose, philosophy, and governance for a core architectural framework.  
**Examples:**  
- ECL Manifesto  
- MxVA Manifesto  

### 5.2 **System Manifesto**  
Provides the intent and guiding principles for a full system or subsystem.  
**Examples:**  
- Phoenix Workbench Manifesto  
- GlossRP Manifesto  

### 5.3 **Protocol Manifesto**  
Articulates why a protocol exists and what behaviors it governs.  
**Examples:**  
- STMG Manifesto  
- COS Manifesto  

### 5.4 **Architecture Manifesto**  
Defines the high-level doctrine behind a major architectural model.  
**Examples:**  
- Spin-Up Architecture Manifesto (SLA)  
- SAAS-Node Architecture Manifesto  

### 5.5 **Role Manifesto**  
Guides role behavior and responsibility boundaries.  
**Examples:**  
- EnaC Role Manifesto series (Architect, Coding LLM, Analyst)

## 6. SCS Blocks  

### SCS-T1  
A short purpose + principle summary enabling a T1-level AI to maintain correct high-level intention when using Frameworks or Protocols governed by a Manifesto.

### SCS-T2  
Provides operationalized interpretation rules, cognitive guardrails, and boundaries relevant for T2 activities: coding, analysis, refactoring, or design.

### SCS-T3  
Defines deep reasoning alignment, cross-framework coherence, and SKY-level philosophy needed for meta-design, evolution, and high-order architecture work.

---

## 7. Historical Notes  
Manifestos emerged organically as highly complex UCS/EnaC systems began developing multiple layers of semantics, rules, modules, and tools.  
Repeated cross-session drift, unintended conflation, and framework misinterpretation made it clear that each major system required a philosophical anchor.  
Manifestos now serve as stable, long-lived north-star documents that evolve slowly while systems evolve rapidly underneath them.
