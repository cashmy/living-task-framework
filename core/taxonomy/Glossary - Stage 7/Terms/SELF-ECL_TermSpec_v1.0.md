# SELF‑ECL — Self Evolutionary Context Layering — Term Specification v1.0

## 0. Metadata
- **Term ID:** SELF-ECL
- **Version:** v1.0
- **Status:** Active
- **Last Updated:** 2025-11-16
- **Steward:** Cash Myers
- **Domain:** Human Cognitive Architecture / Personal Meaning Framework
- **Scope Notes:** SELF‑ECL is *not* an AI subsystem. It represents the user’s personal, emotional, cognitive, and experiential meaning architecture. It informs—but never directs—EnaC.

## 1. Term Identity

### 1.1 Primary Name
- **Name:** Self Evolutionary Context Layering
- **Acronym:** SELF‑ECL
- **Short Handle:** self-layering

### 1.2 Concise Purpose
SELF‑ECL encodes the user’s personal cognitive architecture—layers of meaning shaped by experience, identity, values, and emotional context.

## 2. Canonical Definitions

### 2.1 Architecture-Facing Definition
SELF‑ECL is a human‑derived contextual layering model that represents the user’s personal meaning structure: emotional salience, lived experience, identity‑rooted perspectives, internal narratives, and cognitive biases. It acts as a *contextual informant* to the EnaC system—shaping interpretation and relevance—without imposing behavioral directives or prescriptive rules on AI systems.

### 2.2 Human-Facing Summary
SELF‑ECL is your own internal map of meaning. It reflects what matters to you, why it matters, and how your experiences shape the way you interpret ideas.

### 2.3 SCS‑T1 Anchor (≤ 25 words)
User’s personal cognitive meaning architecture that informs contextual relevance without directing or constraining AI behavior.

## 3. Subsystem Views (Optional)

### 3.1 EnaC Perspective
SELF‑ECL provides EnaC with a *human meaning lens*. It gives clarity on user significance, emotional context, and interpretive patterns while preventing AI overreach or personality modeling.

### 3.2 SELF-ECL Perspective
Reflects lived experience, emotional truths, personal insights, identity layers, intellectual history, and meaning-making over time.

### 3.3 ABS / ARS / Meaning‑Weight Interactions
- **ABS:** Uses SELF‑ECL insights to avoid tone/behavioral mismatch.
- **ARS:** Uses SELF‑ECL informants to reduce misrecognition of emotional or cognitive patterns.
- **Meaning‑Weight:** SELF‑ECL determines personal importance; Meaning‑Weight determines system importance.

### 3.4 Other Subsystems
- **SCS:** SELF‑ECL influences contextual interpretation but does not modify canonical structures.

## 4. Behavioral Implications

### 4.1 When This Term Matters
- When AI requires awareness of human meaning without directive entanglement.
- When preserving user autonomy in cognitive frameworks.
- When contextual misalignment risks misunderstanding or emotional dissonance.
- When high‑salience topics appear in conversation.

### 4.2 Failure Modes
- AI mistakenly treating SELF‑ECL as behavioral instruction.
- Over-modeling the user (violates EnaC boundaries).
- Flattening complex human meaning into simplistic categories.
- Allowing SELF‑ECL to distort canonical AI reasoning layers.

### 4.3 Observable Signals
- High coherence between system responses and user meaning.
- Reduced emotional friction.
- Increased clarity in high‑salience contexts.
- Stronger resonance and reduced cognitive dissonance.

## 5. Historical / Evolution (Optional)

### 5.1 Origin Context
Born from Cash Myers’ profound introspective insights into personal meaning, emotional resonance, and internal growth during deep EnaC development and collaborative ideation.

### 5.2 Revision History
v1.0 — First formal specification differentiating personal meaning architecture from AI directive systems.

### 5.3 Deprecated Meanings
- Incorrect drift term: “ECL‑SELF” (was mistakenly treated as AI subsystem).
- Clarified separation from EnaC and system directive logic.

## 6. References

### 6.1 Primary Sources
- Personal_CFP‑ECL_moment.md
- Captured_ECL_Revolution_Insight.md
- Glossary.md

### 6.2 Secondary Sources
- EnaC human‑alignment notes
- Meaning‑Weight contextual integration notes

### 6.3 External Influences (Optional)
None.

## 7. RDP / Safety Notes
- **Allowed Refactors:** Clarify human‑meaning structure; update personal layers.
- **Forbidden Refactors:** Treating SELF‑ECL as AI behavior instruction.
- **Additional Notes:** SELF‑ECL is *descriptive*, not prescriptive; *personal*, not system logic.
