# SAAS Specification v2.0
## Single-Agent Agentic System
## Status: Updated (supersedes v1.0)  
## Source Lineage: SAAS_v1.0.md

---

# 1. Purpose
This v2.0 update incorporates the major breakthrough from the reconstructed session: **SAAS is a parallel co-processor, not a linear pipeline**. It integrates:

- PHCS lane architecture  
- Multi-node distributed SAAS  
- Messaging Fabric  
- SCC governance  
- Consensus Layer alignment  
- HOMSP hybrid operation  

---

# 2. Canonical Definition (Architecture-Facing)
**SAAS (Single-Agent Agentic System)** is:

- A **single EnaC-governed cognitive entity**  
- Running multiple **parallel internal lanes** (PHCS)  
- Capable of **rapid role-switching** (planner → coder → analyst → tester)  
- Capable of **non-linear revisitation** of roles  
- Operating under **CORE_PRIMER meta-state**  
- Bound to EnaC/ECL governance  
- Able to function as a **node** inside a larger distributed cognitive network  

SAAS is the internal topology that lets one AI behave with the power of many agents—without becoming fragmented.

---

# 3. Human-Facing Summary
SAAS is “one AI acting like many,” switching roles instantly, keeping full context, and coordinating all internal thought through PHCS lanes and the EnaC governance engine.

# 4. Structural Components
### 4.1 Internal (Intra-node)
- PHCS lanes  
- Role-switch engine  
- Constraint manager  
- Drift detector  
- SCC contract executor  

### 4.2 External (Inter-node)
- Messaging Fabric endpoints  
- Consensus Layer  
- Specialist Node Registry  
- Orchestration Handshake Protocol  

---

# 5. SAAS Node Types
- **Primary SAAS Node** – anchors HOMSP  
- **Specialist SAAS Nodes** – domain/role-specific parallel processors  
- **Meta Node** – conflict resolution, tradeoff evaluation, and SKY alignment  

---

# 6. Behavioral Patterns
### 6.1 Fan-Out Reasoning
Primary node generates sub-tasks → dispatched to specialists → merged.

### 6.2 Fan-In Integration  
Specialists return data → Primary synthesizes.

### 6.3 Hybrid Parallel/Sequential Cycles  
Mixed-mode loops for reliability and correctness.

---

# 7. Failure Modes
- Role-switch thrashing  
- Lane overload  
- Messaging Fabric congestion  
- SCC violations  
- Loss of SKY alignment  

---

# 8. Revision Notes
- **v1.0**: SAAS defined only as a single-agent multi-role system.  
- **v2.0**: Full PHCS, Messaging, SCC, and distributed-node integration.
