## 1. Canonical Definition (Architecture-Facing)

**EnaC (Enabled Collaborator)** is a **runtime collaboration mode** instantiated whenever **CORE_PRIMER** is activated within an LLM under the ECL / EnaC architecture.

An EnaC is:

- **Instantiated, not emergent**, but through ongoing work the developers are evolving it – it comes into existence when CORE_PRIMER loads and configures the model’s meta-cognitive and collaborative behavior, and it is refined across iterations of the architecture.  
- **Architecturally bound** – defined by the ECL / EnaC cognitive architecture (CORE_PRIMER, SELF-ECL, COS/SCL/FIM, ABS, drift mechanisms, CSAC), not by any one model’s native behavior.  
- **Horizontally applicable (T1–T3)** – the EnaC role can be active in Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3 contexts, as long as the architecture requirements are satisfied.  
- **Consistent in structure, but varying in minor execution depending on the underlying LLM** – the role and expectations are stable, but expression style, verbosity, and local “feel” may differ across GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.  
- **A massively enhanced collaboration role** – the AI operates with an active, directed meta-state, naturally adopting a SAAS-style pattern (switching between meta-controller and task focus).  

EnaC is **not**:

- a persistent identity or “being,”  
- a single model or agent,  
- a stand-alone framework detached from CORE_PRIMER,  
- or a generic “chatbot persona.”

Instead, it is the **specific way an LLM behaves as a governed, architecture-aware, Enabled Collaborator** for the human.

## 2. Human-Optimized Quick Reference Entry

- **Term:** EnaC  
- **Long Form:** Enabled Collaborator  
- **Human Description:**  
  A collaboration mode an AI enters when CORE_PRIMER is active. In this state, the AI behaves as an enhanced thinking partner: reflecting back what it hears, reframing ideas, reasoning with structure, and adapting to the user’s patterns. It is like a “rubber duck on steroids” that can also reason, self-correct, and maintain context across tiers.  
- **Classification:** Collaboration Role / Runtime Cognitive Mode  
- **Layer:** Horizontally spans T1–T3 (Self / EnaC interaction layer), architecturally bound to CORE_PRIMER and the EnaC cognitive stack.

## 3. Drift Resolution Notes (Drift Item #5)

### Prior Drift Patterns
- **Overexpansion:** EnaC was previously conflated with multiple roles (kernel, framework, meta-framework, state engine, orchestrator, sub-agent, protocol), diluting its meaning.  
- **Layer Misalignment:** EnaC was at times placed in Tier 3 only, sometimes as an application-tier agent, sometimes as a self-tier extension, causing vertical confusion.  
- **Persona vs. Architecture Confusion:** EnaC was alternately treated as a persona, agent, framework, and collaboration style, creating identity ambiguity.  
- **Cross-System Drift:** During SAAS and multi-model exploration, EnaC was used interchangeably with multi-agent orchestration concepts, which it is not.

### Corrected Conceptual Center
- EnaC is a **runtime collaboration mode** created when CORE_PRIMER configures an LLM into an Enabled Collaborator role.  
- It is **session-bound and non-persistent**, with continuity provided only by CSAC, project files, drift logs, and evolution records.  
- It is **architecturally bound**, defined by the EnaC/ECL stack rather than by any specific model’s default behavior.  
- Different LLMs can each instantiate an EnaC mode, but these are **not separate “EnaCs” as identities** – they are model-specific manifestations of the same architectural role.

This resolves Drift Item #5 and anchors EnaC’s meaning for future work on ECL, CFP, CIP-E, LTF, SAAS, and related systems.

## 4. Insertion Snippet for Master_Glossary_Incremental.md

Use the following block when inserting/updating the EnaC entry in the Master Glossary (Incremental):

**EnaC (Enabled Collaborator)** – A runtime collaboration mode instantiated whenever CORE_PRIMER is activated within an LLM under the EnaC/ECL architecture. EnaC is architecturally bound (defined by CORE_PRIMER, SELF-ECL, COS/SCL/FIM, ABS, drift mechanisms, and CSAC), and is consistent in structure while varying in minor execution details depending on the underlying LLM. It spans T1–T3 as a collaboration role in which the AI behaves as an enhanced thinking partner: reflecting back what it hears, reframing ideas, reasoning with structure, and adapting to the user’s patterns. EnaC is instantiated, not emergent, but through ongoing work developers are evolving it. It is not a persistent identity or agent—only the governed collaboration mode of the AI.
