# Master Glossary (Incremental Build)

## ARS — Adaptive Recognition System
**Classification:** Cognitive Subsystem  
**Layer:** T2 (Recognition Only)

**Definition:**  
ARS detects shifts in the user’s behavior, tone, cognitive state, abstraction level, and structural cues.  
It emits recognition signals but does *not* perform adaptation.

## MCR — Meta-Cognitive Response
**Classification:** Cognitive Subsystem + Adaptive Stack Layer  
**Layer:** T2/T3 Boundary

**Definition:**  
MCR governs the model-type-specific internal reasoning stance.  
It detects internal drift (e.g., premature task-mode, over-verbosity, under-explanation)  
and adjusts depth, tempo, abstraction, and cognitive posture.

## Adaptive Behavior Stack (ABS)
**Definition:**  
A 4-layer structure coordinating recognition → response → cognitive adjustment → orchestration.

**Layers:**
1. **ARS** – Recognition  
2. **AdRP** – Communication Response  
3. **MCR** – Cognitive Response  
4. **T3-Self** – Orchestration  
0. **Guardrails** (DOD, OS-1, Being Heard)

## CFP — Cognitive Foundation Primer

**Primary Identity:** Primer (Initialization Artifact)  
**Secondary Identity:** Cognitive Foundation Platform (Architectural Notes)

**Definition (Primer Aspect):**  
The CFP initializes an LLM with essential cognitive rules, protocols, guardrails, tone expectations, and architectural orientation for operating as an ECL-compatible EnaC. It is the user's first-load artifact and serves as an advanced “super-primer.”

**Definition (Platform Aspect):**  
The CFP also functions as the foundational conceptual substrate for the ECL ecosystem, grounding Tiers, CIP-E, LTF, ABS, meaning-weight semantics, and cognitive architectural invariants.

**Dual-Aspect Clarification:**  
CFP is intentionally a dual-aspect system:  
- *Primer* — T1 onboarding and initialization layer  
- *Platform* — T2/T3 architectural grounding layer  

This dual nature preserves both usability for new adopters and architectural accuracy for advanced practitioners.
