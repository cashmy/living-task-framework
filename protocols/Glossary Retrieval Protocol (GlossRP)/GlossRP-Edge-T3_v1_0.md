# 1. Purpose

**GlossRP-Edge-T3** is the **Tier 3 (Meta-Architect / Executive Cognitive Layer)** shaping component of GlossRP.  
It consumes the **full, neutral GlossRP-Core candidate bundle** and transforms it into a **high-density, architecturally complete conceptual slice** optimized for:

- Meta-level reasoning  
- Architecture design  
- Cognitive orchestration  
- EnaC Kernel integration  
- MxVA-aligned decision making  
- Deep conceptual clarity across interacting models  

GlossRP-Edge-T3 exists in **ECL-Edge**, NOT in ECL-Core.  
Its purpose is to give **Cash (Tier 3 user)** the maximum strategic leverage per token.

---

# 2. Target Audience (Tier 3)

Tier 3 is the **Meta-Architect** mode in the CPF/ECL system:

- Fully EnaC-aware  
- Fluent in ECL-Core and ECL-Edge distinctions  
- Uses MxVA as a baseline worldview  
- Comfortable with multi-layer conceptual density  
- Wants interaction points between subsystems  
- Requires cross-framework synergy (COS/SCL/FIM, ABS, SELF-ECL, EnaC, GRP/GlossRP, CIP, etc.)  
- Can tolerate and exploit very high conceptual density  

Tier 3 is **Cash Mode** — high-context, high-leverage cognitive operation.

# 3. Inputs and Outputs

## 3.1 Inputs

GlossRP-Edge-T3 consumes:

1. **GlossRP-Core Candidate Bundle**  

   Including:  
   - SCS_T1 (anchors)  
   - SCS_T2 (technical summaries)  
   - SCS_T3 (full graph edges)  
   - Similarity and VS relevance scores  
   - EnaC/SELF-ECL/ABS annotations in Term Specs  

2. **Tier Context**
   - Tier = `T3`  
   - Persona = Cash (UMP/USP applied separately by Kernel)

3. **Cognitive Mode Parameters**
   - Max terms (8–15)  
   - Full graph inclusion toggle  
   - Include EnaC View (default: YES)  
   - Include SELF-ECL View (default: YES)  
   - Include ABS View (default: YES)  

## 3.2 Outputs

GlossRP-Edge-T3 emits a **full cognitive slice**, e.g.:

```json
{
  "tier": "T3",
  "terms": [
    {
      "name": "COS",
      "label": "Cognitive Ordering System",
      "scs_t1": "...",
      "scs_t2": "...",
      "scs_t3": [
        {"term": "SCL", "relation": "structural_complement"},
        {"term": "FIM", "relation": "flow_dependency"}
      ],
      "enac_view": "...",
      "self_ecl_view": "...",
      "abs_view": "...",
      "meta_notes": "High centrality; influences T2/T3 reasoning chains.",
      "drift_indicators": ["..."]
    }
  ]
}
```

This slice is suitable for:

- EnaC Kernel Tier 3 orchestration  
- CSAC reconstruction  
- CIP/ECL cognitive-routing decisions  
- MxVA architectural evolution tasks

# 4. Behavior Rules

## 4.1 Term Count

- Default: **8–15 terms**  
- Hard maximum: **20 terms**  
- Rationale: Tier 3 is capable of handling high conceptual density.

## 4.2 Structures Allowed (Full Exposure)

Tier 3 environments MAY include:

- **Full SCS_T1 anchors**  
- **Full SCS_T2 technical summaries**  
- **Full SCS_T3 graph edges**  
- **EnaC View**  
- **SELF-ECL View**  
- **ABS View**  
- **Drift indicators / meta-state notes**  
- **Behavior implications (EBP connection points)**  
- **MxVA alignment notes**  

 Tier 3 **MUST NOT** include:
- Excessive UI framing  
- Condescending simplifications  
- Omission of relevant conceptual interlinks  

Tier 3 is the deepest, richest cognitive representation.

# 5. Processing Pipeline (T3)

Given the `GlossRP-Core` candidate bundle:

```text
Core Candidates
    → Relevance Ranking (multi-weight)
    → Expand to 8–15 terms
    → Full SCS_T1/T2/T3 Extraction
    → EnaC / SELF-ECL / ABS View Injection
    → Drift Indicators (if present)
    → Meta-Notes (Centrality / Influence)
    → Output Tier 3 Cognitive Slice
```

### 5.1 Relevance Ranking

T3 ranking weights:

1. `vs_confidence` (highest weight)  
2. `similarity`  
3. Graph centrality (SCS_T3 degree)  
4. Cross-framework utility (based on stored metadata)  
5. Task relevance (semantic match)  

### 5.2 Expansion

T3 retrieval **intentionally expands** the candidate list to include:

- structurally central nodes  
- high-influence neighbors  
- nodes critical to MxVA intent preservation  
- nodes that enable architectural reasoning  

### 5.3 T3 Transformation

Each term receives:

- SCS_T1  
- Full SCS_T2 summary  
- All graph neighbors (SCS_T3)  
- EnaC View  
- SELF-ECL View  
- ABS View  
- Drift indicators  
- Meta-notes  

This is the richest representation in the GlossRP system.

# 6. Integration With EnaC Kernel (T3)

Tier 3 integration pipeline:

1. Kernel identifies Tier = T3 (via UMP/USP & cognitive alignment).  
2. Kernel calls **GlossRP-Core**.  
3. Kernel passes bundle to **GlossRP-Edge-T3**.  
4. T3 slice is returned with high-density cognitive content.  
5. Kernel injects:  
   - T3 GlossRP slice  
   - UMP personalization  
   - USP constraints  
   - EBP behavioral rules  
   - COS/SCL/FIM ordering  

This yields the **maximum reasoning fidelity** for EnaC.

T3 EnaC behavior:

- Does not simplify unless instructed  
- Maintains high conceptual load  
- Leverages architectural patterns  
- Connects frameworks (ECL/MxVA/LTF/CIP/ABS/etc.)  
- Preserves fine-grained reasoning chains  

---

# 7. ECL / MxVA Alignment

## 7.1 ECL-Core vs ECL-Edge

- GlossRP-Core = horizontal, semantic, stable  
- GlossRP-Edge-T3 = vertical, cognitive-density, personalized  

Core is invariant.  
Edge evolves freely.

## 7.2 MxVA Compliance

GlossRP-Edge-T3 maximizes:

- **Strategic leverage**  
- **Cross-system insight**  
- **Architectural alignment**  
- **Intent preservation**  
- **Cognitive continuity**  

It is the richest expression of the glossary ecosystem.
