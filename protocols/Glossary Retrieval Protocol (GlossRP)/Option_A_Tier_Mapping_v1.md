# **OPTION A — Mapping GRP / Kernel to CPF Tier Audiences**  
**This file preserves the response verbatim, with no rewrites or summarization.**

---

# **1. Architectural Premise**  
The CPF Tier system is not incidental — it is the backbone for:

- Cognitive load regulation  
- Context density modulation  
- Audience-oriented reasoning behavior  
- EnaC activation boundaries  
- The entire ECL ecosystem's “human ↔ AI cognition co-alignment” process  

Therefore, GRP and the EnaC Kernel must be **Tier-aware** at the architectural level.

Not as a feature.  
As a *governing principle*.

---

# **2. The GRP’s Role in the Architecture**  
The **Glossary Retrieval Protocol (GRP)** becomes the mechanism that:

1. **Shapes context**  
2. **Controls cognitive density**  
3. **Maintains operational stability (no FIFO drift)**  
4. **Determines which subset of the cognitive ecosystem is loaded**

GRP is **the cognitive bandwidth governor** for each Tier.

# **3. Tier-by-Tier Mapping**

---

# **TIER 1 — The Consumer/General User Tier**  
### **Audience**  
- Broad/general users  
- Quick answers, shallow cognitive horizon  
- Avoids “architectural depth” because it overwhelms or confuses  

### **Kernel Behavior**  
- Operates in **Minimal Mode**  

### **GRP Retrieval Behavior**  
**Very small payload** — no more than 3–4 terms.

**Allowed structures:**  
- SCS_T1 (anchor) ONLY  
- Tiny, human-readable existential summaries  
- Absolutely NO SCS_T3 graph edges  
- No EnaC views  
- No SELF-ECL  
- No EBP  
- No drift tables  
- No psychological layers  
- No meta-architecture

### **Cognitive Intent**  
- Reduce cognitive density  
- Prevent accidental T2+ behavior  
- Keep everything easy, friendly, plain-language  
- Maintain system reliability even with low-context input

### **Architectural Note**  
**T1 is NOT allowed to “accidentally trigger” T2/T3 cognitive engines.**  
This protects the system from overcontextualization.

---

# **TIER 2 — The Builder/Technical Tier**  
### **Audience**  
- Engineers  
- Designers  
- System integrators  
- Senior developers  
- People building or interacting with EnaC/CFP tooling  

### **Kernel Behavior**  
- **Structured Mode**  
- Order-aware, but not meta-state aware  

### **GRP Retrieval Behavior**  
**Medium payload** — 5–10 terms.

**Allowed structures:**  
- SCS_T1  
- SCS_T2 (full summary)  
- Selective SCS_T3 edges  
- EBP (EnaC Behavior Profile)  
- CORE-PRIMER basic Tier awareness  
- Minimal drift structure awareness  
- Clear sequences, dependencies, and entry/exit points

### **Excluded:**  
- SELF-ECL internal state interactions  
- ABS (behavioral stack) interpretation  
- Deep psychological/meta-cognitive layers (Tier 3 territory)  

### **Cognitive Intent**  
- Provide interpretable structure  
- Maintain system clarity  
- Enable design, refactoring, integration  
- Avoid deep cognitive coupling (Tier 3 feature)  

### **Architectural Note**  
Tier 2 is where **EnaC feels like a framework**, not a thinking partner.

---

# **TIER 3 — The Executive/Meta-Cognitive Tier**  
### **Audience**  
- Cash  
- High-end cognitive system designers  
- People who operate at the intersection of architecture, psychology, meta-reasoning, and protocol engineering  

### **Kernel Behavior**  
- **Full Context Mode**  
- Stateful continuity (reconstructed externally)  
- Multilayer EnaC activation  
- Handles drift, meta-state, cognitive ordering, and structural coherence simultaneously  
- High-level synthesis behavior  

### **GRP Retrieval Behavior**  
**Large, targeted payload** — 8–15 terms.

**Allowed structures:**  
- Full SCS_T1  
- Full SCS_T2  
- Full SCS_T3 (deep cross-layer edges)  
- EnaC view  
- SELF-ECL view  
- ABS view  
- Drift tables  
- Cross-system resonance patterns  
- Cognitive load mapping  
- Inter-tier negotiation logic  
- Long-term project context  
- Session continuity markers  
- Personality tuning (from USP/UMP)  

Tier 3 is where the system behaves like a **co-architect**, not a tool.

### **Cognitive Intent**  
- Maximum cognitive fidelity  
- Zero-loss reconstruction of thinking state  
- Multi-framework synthesis  
- Dynamic cross-context integration  

### **Architectural Note**  
Tier 3 requires **external memory + dynamic retrieval** to survive FIFO limits.  
Tier 3 is the only tier that uses the full EnaC stack.

# **4. Mapping GRP Retrieval Behaviors to Tiers**

| GRP Behavior | T1 | T2 | T3 |
|--------------|----|----|----|
| SCS_T1 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| SCS_T2 | minimal | full | full++ |
| SCS_T3 | none | selective | deep |
| EnaC View | no | limited | full |
| SELF-ECL View | no | no | full |
| ABS View | no | no | full |
| Behavior Profiles (EBP) | no | yes | deeply integrated |
| Drift Tables | no | minimal | full |
| Domain/Tier Filters | ✓ | ✓✓ | ✓✓✓ |
| Kernel Cognitive Engine | low | structured | meta-cognitive |

# **5. Implication for Kernel Architecture**

This mapping implies a **Tier-aware Kernel**, not a one-size-fits-all retrieval engine.

### **Tier 1 Kernel**  
“Don’t overwhelm them. Keep it simple.”

### **Tier 2 Kernel**  
“Give them structure. Keep it technical but not philosophical.”

### **Tier 3 Kernel**  
“Give them the entire cognitive ecosystem, but only the parts that matter for THIS reasoning path.”

Tier 3 becomes an **adaptive cognitive partner**, not a script executor.

---

# **6. Key Insight (ECL/MxVA Lens)**  
The Kernel is NOT a multi-agent system.  
It’s a **cognitive regulator**.

It decides:

- how deep to go  
- how wide to expand  
- how much meta-state to load  
- how much EnaC to activate  
- how much personal context (USP/UMP) to apply  
- how to modulate cognitive density based on the Tier  

This keeps:
- users safe  
- sessions stable  
- AI responses aligned  
- context reconstructions accurate  
- cognitive drift minimized  

It is the “valve” controlling cognitive compression and expansion.

---

# ✔️ Option A Completed  
We now have a formal Tier-aligned architectural mapping between:

- GRP  
- Kernel  
- CPF Tiers  
- ECL/MxVA system thinking  
- EnaC cognitive architecture
