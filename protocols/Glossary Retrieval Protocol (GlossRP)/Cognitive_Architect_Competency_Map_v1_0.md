# Cognitive Architect Competency Map
## Role Archetype: Cognitive Infrastructure Architect / AI Systems Meta-Designer
### Version 1.0 | November 2025

---

# 1. Core Competencies (Fundamental Cognitive Architecture Skills)

## 1.1 Multi-Layer System Design
Designing architectures composed of semantic substrates, reasoning kernels, tiered interfaces, retrieval pipelines, personalization layers, and cognitive governance contracts.

**Outcome:** Architectures that can think, evolve, and maintain consistency across contexts.

## 1.2 Semantic Substrate Engineering
Building term specification schemas, hierarchical semantic structures, SCS models, conceptual graphs, and semantic retrieval mediums.

**Outcome:** AI that understands meaning structures, not just text.

## 1.3 AI Reasoning Pipeline Design
Governing how AI thinks, what steps occur, how context is injected, and how drift is prevented.

**Outcome:** Stable, predictable reasoning aligned to human intent.

## 1.4 Tiered Cognitive Modeling
Defining cognitive modes for:
- **T1 — Consumer**
- **T2 — Builder/Engineer**
- **T3 — Meta-Architect**

**Outcome:** One AI serving multiple audiences safely.

## 1.5 Retrieval Architecture Design
Vector search, graph expansion, semantic bundles, tier filters, relevance heuristics.

**Outcome:** Retrieval of concepts that matter, not noise.

## 1.6 Persona + Cognitive Alignment Integration
Aligning AI to human cognitive styles, patterns, and preferences.

**Outcome:** AI that collaborates like a cognitive peer.

## 1.7 Architectural Governance
Defining invariants, contracts, evolution rules, and safety boundaries.

**Outcome:** Systems that grow without collapsing.

# 2. Meta-Competencies (Tier-3 Level)

## 2.1 Meta-Recursive Reasoning
Architectures that reason about their own reasoning.

## 2.2 Cross-Session Cognitive Reconstruction (CSAC)
Systems that persist and rehydrate cognition across resets.

## 2.3 Multi-Framework Integration
Unifying EnaC, GlossRP, ECL-Core/Edge, CSAC, MxVA, UMP/USP/EBP, and SCS models.

## 2.4 AI-Orchestrated Co-Creation
Designing structured, multi-agent, multi-tier collaboration.

## 2.5 Human Cognitive Modeling
Mapping and codifying a human's reasoning blueprint.

---

# 3. Technical Competencies

## 3.1 Knowledge Representation
Semantic graphs, ontologies, vector stores, hierarchical term models.

## 3.2 Cognitive Retrieval Engineering
Hybrid search, semantic slicing, tier relevance weighting.

## 3.3 Kernel & Orchestration Logic
Routing, sequencing, context building, multi-model coordination.

## 3.4 Architectural Prototyping
DB design, ingestion pipelines, transformation logic, service planning.

---

# 4. Tier-Aligned Competencies

## Tier 1 – Distillation
Clear, simplified, intuitive representations.

## Tier 2 – Systems Integration
Structural diagrams, logic maps, implementation guides.

## Tier 3 – Meta-Architecture
Recursive frameworks, cognitive governance, multi-layer orchestration.

# 5. Emerging Future Competencies (Already in Active Development)

## 5.1 Multi-Agent Cognitive Coordination
Complex agent dynamics and collaboration.

## 5.2 Cognitive Load Budgeting
Abstraction modulation, flow-state management.

## 5.3 Cognitive Infrastructure Security
Identity integrity, drift protection, reasoning audits.

## 5.4 Organizational Cognitive Architecture
Enterprise-wide cognitive governance structures.
