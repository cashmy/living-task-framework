# 📗 The Co-Creation Companion Workbook (v0.1 — Pilot Edition)

- A practical guide to mastering Collaborative AI Fluency through Directive + Meta Prompting (DMP), Contextual Inference Prompting (CIP), and Variable Synchronicity (VS).*

- --

## Part I — Foundations of AI Co-Creation

- *Goal:** Build awareness of how reflective collaboration changes cognition.

### Exercise 1.1 — Mapping Your Current Creative Flow

Identify where ideas form, pause, and fade. Use a reflective timeline or journal entry.

### Exercise 1.2 — Dialogue Awareness

Rewrite one of your ordinary prompts as a DMP. Compare the results.

- *Reflection:** What changed in clarity, emotional tone, or alignment with your goals?

- --

## Part II — DMP Mastery: From Template to Narrative

- *Goal:** Learn to move fluently between structured and narrative co-creation.

### Mini-Lesson

Review the DMP Communication Styles Guide.

### Exercise 2.1 — Template Practice

Fill in the blanks for DMP components (META, DIRECTIVE, REFLECTIVE).

### Exercise 2.2 — Narrative Rewrites

Rewrite 5 template DMPs as natural language prompts.

### Exercise 2.3 — Reverse Engineering Practice

Take a narrative prompt and reconstruct it as a structured DMP.

- *Reflection:** Where does structure help, and where does it hinder creativity?

- --

## Part III — CIP Awareness: Contextual Inference in Action

- *Goal:** Practice framing, referencing, and guiding context.

### Mini-Lesson

Understand the three layers of context: immediate, extended, and semantic.

### Exercise 3.1 — Identify Implicit Context

Find missing context in example prompts.

### Exercise 3.2 — Context Expansion

Add richer context layers to underdefined prompts.

- *Reflection:** When does context enhance meaning vs. create cognitive friction?

- --

## Part IV — VS Calibration: Learning to Adjust Synchronicity

- *Goal:** Tune your collaborative rhythm with AI.

### Mini-Lesson

Differentiate between high vs. low synchronicity prompting.

### Exercise 4.1 — Reflective Rewriting

Convert a fast TOFP (Task-Oriented Formulaic Prompt) into a reflective VS prompt.

### Exercise 4.2 — Meta vs. Micro Alignment

Identify moments to request reflection vs. execution.

- *Reflection:** What is your natural synchronicity preference when collaborating with AI?

- --

## Part V — Integrating the Frameworks

- *Goal:** Combine DMP, CIP, and VS into real-world creative systems.

### Exercise 5.1 — Create a Co-Creation Flow

Map your personal or team creative cycle using DMP and CIP.

### Exercise 5.2 — Human + AI Coordination

Use DMP to design reflective collaboration between human and AI (or multiple AIs).

- *Reflection:** What surprised you most about AI as a reflective collaborator?

- --

## Part VI — Living Tasks & Reflective Dashboard

- *Goal:** Connect daily reflection to evolving creative ecosystems.

### Mini-Lesson

Review the Living Task Framework (LTF) Overview.

### Exercise 6.1 — Design Your Reflective Dashboard

Sketch your dashboard layout: reflection inputs, metrics, daily summaries.

### Exercise 6.2 — Daily Reflection Tracking

Capture DMP interactions, reflections, and emergent insights in your dashboard.

- *Reflection:** How did today’s dialogue shape tomorrow’s cognition?

- --

## Part VII — Integration Projects

- *Goal:** Apply all learned tools in a real use case.

### Project 1 — Build a Reflective Prompt Library

Collect and categorize DMP, CIP, and VS prompts that work best for your domain.

### Project 2 — Design an AI Thought Capture Workflow

Develop a system (using your preferred tools) that captures and classifies liminal thoughts.

### Project 3 — Conduct a Co-Authored Whitepaper Experiment

Collaborate with AI to research, draft, and publish a reflective whitepaper.

- *Reflection:** What does co-creation mean to you now? How has it changed your sense of authorship?
