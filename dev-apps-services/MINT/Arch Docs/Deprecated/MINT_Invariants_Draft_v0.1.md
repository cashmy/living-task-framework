# MINT — Invariants Draft v0.1

## 0. Metadata
- **Subsystem:** MINT (Meaning INference Transformer)
- **Version:** Draft v0.1
- **Status:** Provisional — Subject to refinement
- **Purpose of this Draft:** Capture current MINT invariant structure to prevent conceptual drift during active design.

# 1. SKY‑Level Invariants (Purpose / Existential WHY)

### 1.1 Coherence Preservation
MINT must always exist to preserve semantic coherence across the Unified Cognition Stack (UCS).  
If MINT is removed or bypassed, meaning consistency across tools, tiers, and contexts degrades.

### 1.2 Boundary Protection
MINT must preserve hard boundaries between:
- **Retrieval** (GlossRP)
- **Transformation** (MINT)
- **Evolution** (LTF)
- **Cognition** (EnaC)
- **Artifact Construction** (PW)

MINT must never collapse these boundaries.

### 1.3 Semantic Stability
MINT must ensure that meaning retains its identity across:
- tools,
- EnaCs,
- modes,
- densities,
- sessions.

### 1.4 NLL Alignment of Tier Slices
MINT must interpret T1/T2/T3 shaping through distinct NLL identity frames:
- **T1 → Identity / Essence / “Who”**
- **T2 → Operation / “What + How + Where”**
- **T3 → Systemic Role / “Why + Whom Else”**

This NLL alignment is mandatory and permanent.

# 2. CORE‑Level Invariants (Behavior / Rules)

### 2.1 Transform‑Only Principle
MINT must only **reshape** meaning — never interpret, evolve, or add new meaning.

### 2.2 Tier Slice Generation
MINT must:
- be capable of producing **distinct** T1/T2/T3 slices,
- maintain NLL‑aligned shaping rules,
- never mix Tier roles, and
- generate either individual slices or full bundles **based on caller request**, not internal logic.

### 2.3 Density / DOD Integrity
MINT must modulate meaning density (light/medium/deep) **without losing canonical meaning**.

### 2.4 Determinism
Given identical input + Tier + density → MINT must always return the same output.

### 2.5 No Retrieval Logic
MINT must never retrieve meaning.  
It must only operate on data provided by **GlossRP**.

### 2.6 No Evolution Logic
MINT must never evolve or relate meaning.  
Evolution belongs exclusively to **LTF**.

### 2.7 No Context-Adaptive Interpretation
MINT must not:
- infer new meaning,
- decide context,
- interpret user intent,
- infer personal meaning.

Those belong to EnaCs + CIP‑E.

### 2.8 Purity and Non-Mutation
MINT must not mutate GlossRP data.  
All transformation must be structural, not semantic.

# 3. BASE‑Level Invariants (Structural / Data Constraints)

### 3.1 GlossRP‑First Contract
All semantic inputs must originate from **GlossRP** outputs.  
No alternate sources are allowed.

### 3.2 TierSlice Schema Stability
Data shapes for:
- **TierSlice_T1**
- **TierSlice_T2**
- **TierSlice_T3**
must remain stable across versions (non-breaking changes only).

### 3.3 Consistent Output Contracts
MINT outputs must always be formatted for direct consumption by:
- EnaCs,
- LTF,
- Phoenix Workbench.

### 3.4 Substrate‑Agnostic Operation
MINT must operate identically inside:
- EnaCs,
- PW,
- offline tools,
- batch or streaming environments.

### 3.5 Stateless Operation
MINT must never retain state across transformations.

---

# 4. CROSS‑Layer Universal Invariants

### 4.1 Separation of Tier Knowledge vs. Tier Selection
MINT must know the NLL model and shaping rules for each Tier, but:
- **MINT may not choose which Tier to use.**
Tier selection belongs to EnaC/SAAS.

### 4.2 Meaning‑Purity Guarantee
MINT must never alter, reinterpret, overwrite, or contradict canonical definitions retrieved via GlossRP.

### 4.3 No SCS Regression
MINT must never reabsorb deprecated SCS behaviors:
- retrieval,
- evolution,
- context inference,
- “semantic reasoning.”

### 4.4 Interoperability Preservation
MINT must remain compatible with:
- GlossRP,
- LTF,
- PW,
- EnaCs,
- MxVA/ECL governance.

### 4.5 Minimalism
MINT must remain intentionally small and focused.  
It must not grow into a multi-purpose subsystem.

# 5. Notes on This Draft
This draft exists to preserve conceptual stability during rapid design iteration.  
It is not final, but any modifications must remain consistent with MINT’s:
- existential WHY,
- functional role,
- NLL-aligned Tier model,
- transformation-only nature.
