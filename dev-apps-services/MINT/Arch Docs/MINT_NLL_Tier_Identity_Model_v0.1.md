# MINT NLL–Tier Identity Model v0.1

## Purpose
Define the nested and weighted NLL structure that governs Mint’s Tier shaping.  
This ensures deterministic meaning transformation across T1/T2/T3/T4+ without rigid over-specification.

---

# 1. Core Principle — Nested NLL
Each Tier contains all NLL distinctions:
- Who
- What
- How
- Where
- When
- Why
- Whom Else

But each Tier has a dominant NLL “gravity well.”

# 2. Tier NLL Weighting Model

## T1 — Identity / Essence Layer
- **Primary NLL:** Who  
- **Secondary NLL:** What  
- **Tertiary NLL:** Why / Whom Else  
- **Audience:** Basic user  
- **Purpose:** Establish identity and essence  

---

## T2 — Operational / Mechanics Layer
- **Primary NLL:** What + How  
- **Secondary NLL:** Where / When  
- **Tertiary NLL:** Why  
- **Audience:** Developer  
- **Purpose:** Explain how the term works in practice  

---

## T3 — Systemic / Purpose Layer
- **Primary NLL:** Why + Whom Else  
- **Secondary NLL:** How + What  
- **Tertiary NLL:** Who  
- **Audience:** Enterprise Architect  
- **Purpose:** Provide systemic, relational, purpose-driven perspective  

---

## T4+ — Meta-Cognitive Layer (Awareness Only for MINT)
- **Primary NLL:** Meta-Why / Meta-Whom  
- **Secondary NLL:** Meta-How / Meta-What  
- **Tertiary NLL:** Meta-Where / Meta-When  
- **Audience:** Cognition Architect  
- **Purpose:** Enable evolutionary, meta-systemic alignment  

Mint does **not** generate T4 slices, but must be aware of their NLL gravity to avoid contaminating T3.

# 3. NLL Weighting Rules for Mint

1. Mint must shape meaning using the correct NLL identity per Tier.
2. Mint must not rigidly define specific Who/What/etc. (to preserve generativity).
3. NLL distinctions must be applied as weighted cognitive profiles.
4. Tier shaping = NLL alignment + density modulation.

---

# 4. Resonance with AI Transformative Processing
The weighted NLL structure maps directly to transformer attention layers and distributed semantic nodes.  
This creates:
- native LLM alignment,
- drift resistance,
- simple EnaC integration,
- natural SAAS support.

---

# 5. Notes
This model is foundational for:
- MINT invariants,
- MINT architecture,
- TierSlice shaping rules,
- EnaC reasoning alignment.
