# 1. SKY — Essence, Identity, and Purpose

## 1.1 What MINT *Is*
MINT is the subsystem that transforms **raw semantic essence (Breath)** into **structured, Tier-shaped cognition (Word)**.  
It is the pivotal bridge between:

- **GlossRP** (meaning retrieval) → *Breath*  
- **MINT** (meaning shaping) → *Breath into Word*  
- **LTF** (meaning evolution) → *Word into Ecosystem*  

MINT is neither interpretive nor generative of *new meaning*.  
Its identity is **form-giving**, not **meaning-making**.

---

## 1.2 Why MINT Exists
MINT exists to ensure that every semantic element in the UCS:

- has consistent structure  
- maintains identity coherence  
- is expressible across tiers  
- aligns with NLL weighting  
- preserves purpose throughout transformation  

Without MINT, the entire semantic stack becomes unstable.  
With MINT, every subsystem receives deterministic, drift-resistant meaning-forms.

---

## 1.3 Breath → Word Mandate (Core Identity)
This is the metaphysical and functional identity of MINT:

> **MINT transforms inner-purpose (Breath) into structured expression (Word).**

This mandate governs:
- its invariants  
- its architecture  
- its implementation  
- its cognitive role  

This identity must never be violated.

---

## 1.4 NLL Gravity Alignment
MINT must shape meaning using the **correct NLL gravity model**:
- **T1:** Identity (Who)  
- **T2:** Operation (What/How)  
- **T3:** Systemic Purpose (Why/Whom Else)  
- **T4+:** Awareness only  

This weighting defines MINT’s semantic physics.

---

## 1.5 Boundary Identity
MINT cannot:
- retrieve (GlossRP)  
- interpret (EnaCs)  
- evolve (LTF)  
- architect (PW)  

It **can only shape**.

This boundary is essential for system integrity.

---

# 2. CORE — Functional Architecture, Modules, Behavior

## 2.1 System-Level Architecture Overview
```
GlossRP → MINT → LTF → Phoenix Workbench → EnaCs
```

MINT occupies the transformation layer:
- receives canonical meaning  
- applies NLL-weight shaping  
- produces TierSlices  
- provides deterministic packets to LTF  

---

## 2.2 Internal Module Architecture

### **1. Transform Orchestrator**
Coordinates all internal Mint modules.  
Ensures invariant compliance before output.

### **2. NLL Weight Engine**
Applies correct NLL gravity for T1/T2/T3 shaping.  
Prevents Tier-blending and drift.

### **3. Tier Shaper**
Constructs the cognitive shape for:
- T1 slices  
- T2 slices  
- T3 slices  
- T1+T2+T3 bundles  

### **4. Breath→Word Projection Layer**
Maps ECL SKY/CORE/BASE essence into UCS Word structure.  
Ensures purpose alignment.

### **5. Density / DOD Engine**
Produces Light, Medium, Deep structures without altering meaning.

### **6. Input Contract Verifier**
Validates GlossRP-origin data.  
Rejects contaminated or non-canonical inputs.

### **7. Output Contract Assembler**
Creates the final TierSlice or bundle.  
Adds metadata and validity boundaries.

### **8. Bundle Manager**
Handles multi-slice packaging (T1+T2+T3).  
Ensures cross-slice consistency.

---

## 2.3 Operational Flow
1. Receive term essence from GlossRP  
2. Validate against invariants  
3. Determine requested Tier(s)  
4. Apply NLL weighting  
5. Apply density shaping  
6. Build TierSlice(s)  
7. Assemble TransformPacket  
8. Return to caller (EnaC or subsystem)

---

## 2.4 Behavioral Contracts
- **Deterministic**: Same in → same out  
- **Stateless**: No memory  
- **Pure**: No mutation  
- **Non-interpretive**: No inference  
- **Non-generative**: No meaning creation  

---

# 3. BASE — Logical Structures, Data Models, Implementation

## 3.1 TierSlice Data Model (Simplified)
```
TierSlice {
  tier: T1 | T2 | T3
  nll_weights: {
    who: float
    what: float
    how: float
    why: float
    where: float
    when: float
    whom_else: float
  }
  density: Light | Medium | Deep
  content: structured text block
  metadata: {
    version: string
    source: GlossRP-id
    integrity_hash: sha256
  }
}
```

---

## 3.2 TransformPacket Structure
```
TransformPacket {
  slices: [TierSlice]
  bundle_mode: single | multi
  mint_version: string
  timestamp: utc
}
```

---

## 3.3 Input Contracts
- Must come from GlossRP  
- Must be canonical  
- Must pass NLL compatibility  

---

## 3.4 Output Contracts
Guaranteed:
- drift-resistant  
- deterministic  
- NLL-weighted  
- LTF-ready  
- EnaC-compatible  

---

## 3.5 Versioning and Stability Requirements
- **v0.1**: structural stabilization  
- **v0.2**: invariant alignment  
- **v0.3**: coding-LLM-ready schema  
- **v0.5**: LTF full integration  
- **v1.0**: production-level system

# 4. Milestones

## **0.1 — Initial Structural Manifest**  
This document.

## **0.2 — Invariant Synchronization**  
Ensure architecture and invariants match fully.

## **0.3 — Coding-LLM Implementation Prep**  
TransformPacket + TierSlice tested for code generation.

## **0.5 — LTF Integration Stability**

# 5. Closing Statement
MINT is the semantic heart of the UCS.  
It takes the Breath of meaning and shapes the Word of cognition.

This document defines MINT’s:
- identity  
- purpose  
- architecture  
- internal modules  
- data models  
- operational boundaries  
- system relationships  

It is now ready for iterative evolution toward v1.0.
