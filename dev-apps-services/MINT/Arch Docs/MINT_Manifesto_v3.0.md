# MINT v3.0 — Core Manifesto

## 1. Opening Narrative
A powerful cognitive ecosystem needs more than retrieval and evolution—it needs *preparation*.  
Raw semantic material retrieved from GlossRP cannot flow directly into EnaCs, LTF, or Phoenix Workbench without structural shaping.

Meaning must be **fit for purpose**:
- light for Tier 1,
- practical for Tier 2,
- expansive for Tier 3.

The system once relied on SCS for this, but SCS grew too large and unfocused.  
It mixed retrieval, shaping, interpretation, and context in a way the modern ecosystem no longer needs.

Thus, **MINT was born**:
A small, precise transformer responsible for shaping meaning—nothing more, nothing less.

---

## 2. Identity & Essence
MINT is the **Meaning INference Transformer**:
- A micropipeline of semantic shaping  
- Deterministic  
- Tier‑aware and density‑aware  
- Non‑interpretive  
- Non‑evolutionary  
- Downstream‑aligned

It is the **semantic preparation layer** that ensures every subsystem interacts with consistent, purpose‑shaped meaning.

---

## 3. Core Principles
1. **Transform, don’t interpret.**  
   Meaning is reshaped, not reinvented.

2. **Tier governs form.**  
   T1/T2/T3 slices must differ in density, not identity.

3. **No retrieval, ever.**  
   GlossRP owns all retrieval; MINT consumes only what is given.

4. **No evolution, ever.**  
   LTF owns all lineage and relational development.

5. **Purity of function.**  
   One job: reshape meaning based on rules.

6. **Predictability and determinism.**  
   Same input + same parameters → same output.

7. **Substrate neutrality.**  
   MINT functions identically inside EnaCs, PW, or offline tooling.

---

## 4. What MINT Solves
Without MINT:
- definitions drift across tools  
- EnaCs over‑ or under‑expand meaning  
- PW artifacts become inconsistent  
- LTF has trouble anchoring semantic lineage  
- humans experience definitional mismatch  

With MINT:
- Tier and density become stable  
- Explanation quality becomes predictable  
- EnaCs rely on clean, shaped semantics  
- LTF maintains lineage without noise  
- PW produces consistent artifacts

MINT is the keystone that keeps semantic stability intact.

---

## 5. Ecosystem Role
MINT’s position ensures:
- **retrieval is simple (GlossRP)**
- **transformation is precise (MINT)**
- **evolution is governed (LTF)**
- **architecture is coherent (MxVA)**
- **artifacts are consistent (PW)**
- **cognition is stable (EnaC)**

It fixes the “gaps” left by the death of SCS and the complexity of modern semantic flows.

---

## 6. Human‑Facing Benefits
- Clearer explanations  
- Predictable definitions  
- Less cognitive friction  
- Easier onboarding  
- Stable meaning across tools  
- Reduced confusion in deep sessions  

MINT becomes the “semantic shock absorber” of the UCS.

---

## 7. AI‑Facing Behavioral Directives
When an EnaC invokes MINT:
- follow Tier rules  
- follow DOD rules  
- never alter meaning content  
- transform only the *form*  
- emit deterministic outputs  
- do not retrieve  
- do not evolve  
- do not classify  
- do not generate relationships

MINT is a transformation engine, not a semantic engine.

---

## 8. Interoperation Rules
- **GlossRP → MINT:** semantic inputs only  
- **MINT → LTF:** prepared semantic slices  
- **MINT → PW:** density‑appropriate definition blocks  
- **MINT → EnaC:** meaning slices for reasoning  
- **MINT → SCS:** historical reference only  
- **No Skipping Layers:**  
  EnaCs must not bypass MINT when Tier/density shaping is needed.

---

## 9. Patterns of Use
Use MINT when you need:
- quick Tier‑anchored definitions  
- DOD‑aligned meaning slices  
- structured glossary entries  
- consistent cross‑tool definitions  
- stable anchors for LTF concept evolution  

Do **not** use MINT for retrieval, evolution, classification, summarization, or invention.

---

## 10. Boundaries & Non‑Purposes
MINT must never:
- retrieve semantics  
- create new meaning  
- produce relationships  
- evolve concepts  
- infer personal or contextual interpretations  
- override GlossRP or LTF  

These boundaries guarantee semantic purity.

---

## 11. Evolution Path (TEO + 5‑EAR Aligned)
MINT will evolve by:
- expanding Tier-slice profiles  
- supporting extended density schemas  
- improving interface standards with PW and LTF  
- allowing optional metadata (meaning‑weight, lineage hints)  
- refining transformation grammars  

It will **not** evolve into an interpreter or cognitive subsystem.

---

## 12. Closing Vision Statement
MINT safeguards the integrity of meaning across the entire ecosystem.  
It ensures that every concept, every term, and every definition enters the system shaped for its purpose and positioned for evolution.
