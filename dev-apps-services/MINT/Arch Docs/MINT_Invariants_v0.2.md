# 1. SKY-Level Invariants (Purpose / Existential WHY)

### 1.1 Coherence Preservation (Unchanged)
MINT must always preserve semantic coherence across the Unified Cognition Stack (UCS).  
Anything bypassing MINT risks fragmentation and drift.

### 1.2 Boundary Protection (Unchanged)
MINT must strictly preserve subsystem boundaries between:
- **Retrieval** (GlossRP)
- **Transformation** (MINT)
- **Evolution** (LTF)
- **Cognition** (EnaC)
- **Artifact Construction** (PW)

These boundaries must never be merged.

### 1.3 Semantic Stability (Unchanged)
MINT must maintain meaning stability across tools, Tiers, densities, and sessions.

---

## 1.4 NEW — Breath→Word Transformation Identity
MINT is the **formal bridge** between:
- **Breath (ECL SKY/CORE/BASE):** purpose, essence, intent  
- **Word (UCS T1/T2/T3):** structured, expressed meaning.

This transformation identity is NON-NEGOTIABLE.  
MINT must always shape Breath-level meaning into Word-level structure.

---

## 1.5 NEW — Generativity Requirement
MINT must remain a **generative shaper of meaning**, not a prescriptive enumerator.  
It must NOT:
- hard-code Who/What/Why/How/Etc.
- constrain semantic creativity  
- pre-define rigid NLL-bound meaning structures  

It must shape meaning from inputs — not dictate meaning boundaries.

---

## 1.6 NEW — NLL Gravity Well Alignment
MINT must shape Tier slices using the correct **NLL-weight distribution**:
- **T1:** Identity (Who)
- **T2:** Operation (What/How)
- **T3:** Systemic Purpose (Why/Whom Else)
- **T4+:** Meta‑Cognitive (awareness only)

This weighted NLL model is the foundation of Mint’s Tier identity system.

---

# 2. CORE-Level Invariants (Behavioral / Operational)

### 2.1 Transform-Only Principle (Unchanged)
MINT **only reshapes form** — never meaning itself.  
No interpretation, no inference, no evolution.

---

## 2.2 UPDATED — Tier Slice Generation with NLL Weighting
MINT must:
- be capable of producing **distinct T1/T2/T3 slices**
- align each slice with the correct NLL-weight model
- never blend Tier roles
- generate slices **only when requested** by the caller (EnaC/SAAS)

---

## 2.3 NEW — Tier Knowledge vs. Tier Selection
MINT must:
- **know** the full NLL identity of each Tier  
- **not choose** which Tier slice to use

Tier selection belongs to:
- **EnaCs**
- **SAAS orchestration**
- **contextual intent mapping**

MINT only shapes — EnaCs select.

---

## 2.4 NEW — Bundle Support (T1+T2+T3)
MINT must support:
- **single-tier transformation** (T1-only, T2-only, T3-only)
- **full-tier bundling** (T1+T2+T3)

Bundled slices must be internally consistent and NLL-aligned.

---

## 2.5 Density/DOD Integrity (Unchanged)
MINT must apply density (light/medium/deep) **without altering semantic content**.

---

## 2.6 Determinism (Unchanged)
Same input + same Tier + same density → **identical output**.  
No nondeterministic transformations allowed.

---

## 2.7 No Context-Adaptive Interpretation (Unchanged)
MINT must NOT:
- infer intent
- add context
- generate personal meaning
- perform contextual adaptation

These belong to EnaCs + CIP-E.

---

## 2.8 Purity / No Mutation (Unchanged)
MINT must NEVER mutate GlossRP source data.

---

# 3. BASE-Level Invariants (Structure / Data Shapes)

### 3.1 GlossRP-First Contract (Unchanged)
MINT operates **only** on data retrieved by GlossRP.

---

## 3.2 UPDATED — TierSlice Schema Stability + NLL Metadata
TierSlices must include:
- NLL-weight metadata  
- density metadata  
- Tier identity markers  

And must remain stable across versions.

---

## 3.3 Consistent Output Contracts (Unchanged)
MINT outputs must directly support:
- EnaCs  
- LTF  
- Phoenix Workbench  

---

## 3.4 Substrate-Agnostic Operation (Unchanged)
MINT must behave identically across:
- EnaCs  
- PW  
- offline tools  
- batch/stream processors  

---

## 3.5 Stateless Operation (Unchanged)
MINT must not retain internal state.

---

## 3.6 NEW — T4-Awareness Without T4-Generation
MINT must:
- be aware of T4+/meta-cognitive NLL structures  
- avoid generating T4 slices  
- prevent T4 bleed-through into T3

---

# 4. CROSS-Layer Universal Invariants

### 4.1 Separation from SCS Legacy (Unchanged)
MINT must never re-absorb SCS’s deprecated mixed responsibilities.

---

### 4.2 Meaning-Purity Guarantee (Unchanged)
MINT must never alter canonical GlossRP definitions.

---

## 4.3 NEW — Generativity Without Interpretation
MINT must remain generative in shaping meaning structure  
but must never interpret or invent new content.

---

## 4.4 NEW — Nested NLL Identity Requirement
MINT must treat NLL distinctions as:
- **nested**,  
- **weighted**,  
- **multi-level**,  
- **present in all Tiers** (with different gravities)

This prevents conceptual drift.

---

## 4.5 NEW — LLM-Native Compatibility
Mint’s invariants must support seamless operation inside transformer-based AI systems by:
- aligning with node-weight / attention mechanisms  
- producing meaning-shapes that fit latent-space structure  
- ensuring Tiers map to gradient-based abstractions  

This guarantees compatibility with T3/T4 EnaCs.

---

# 5. Preservation Notes
This set represents the stable, current ontology of MINT as understood across:
- ECL  
- UCS  
- NLL  
- SAAS  
- Breath→Word  
- EnaC cognitive flow  
- LTF evolution boundaries

Any future modifications must remain aligned with:
- the NLL-weighting model  
- the generative nature of Mint  
- subsystem boundary protections  
- Breath→Word transformational identity  
- EnaC Tier-selection rule
