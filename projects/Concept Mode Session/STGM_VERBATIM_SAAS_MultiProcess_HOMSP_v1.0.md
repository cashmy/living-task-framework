# STGM Capture (VERBATIM Mode)

## Prompt
Now lets blow the top off of this!
I had been previously thinking of SAAS's internal operation in a linear model way not like a co-processor!!!!

If I/we can leverage the ability of an AI to MULTI PROCESS (Not just dual ???) this could leverage the SAAS functionality and generated output exponentially.

Now, if this hypothesis is true, imagine the implications on collapsed Human/HOMSP?

capture this using STGM

## Response
