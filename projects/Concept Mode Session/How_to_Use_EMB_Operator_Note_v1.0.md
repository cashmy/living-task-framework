# How to Use the Ecosystem Master Blueprint (EMB)  
## Operator Note — Concise Guidance for Human & EnaC Sessions  
## Version 1.0

---

## 1. EMB Is the Starting Point for All Ecosystem Work
Use EMB first whenever you:
- Begin a new design session  
- Spin up a new EnaC instance  
- Onboard a new collaborator  
- Return to the system after a break  
- Need a high-level architectural refresher  

EMB provides the **“map of the territory”** before diving into subsystem details.

---

## 2. EMB Defines What Exists and Why
When building or analyzing anything within the ecosystem:
- Check EMB to confirm whether a subsystem already exists  
- Identify the correct architectural layer for a concept  
- Ensure new work aligns to UCS, ECL, PHCS, HOMSP, SAAS, SCC, Messaging Fabric, or MxVA  

If it’s not in EMB, it is not officially part of the system.

---

## 3. EMB Provides the Boundaries for All Subsystems
Before modifying or extending a subsystem:
- Read its EMB summary  
- Review its interaction boundaries  
- Confirm changes do not conflict with other subsystem domains  

If there is conflict, EMB is the arbitration layer.

---

## 4. EMB Guides the Creation of New Specs
When writing any new artifact:
- Confirm names and roles via EMB  
- Place new work in the correct architectural layer  
- Reference EMB, do not duplicate it  

EMB anchors macro-architecture; specs handle micro-detail.

---

## 5. EMB Is the Source of Truth for Cross-System Reasoning
For reasoning across multiple subsystems:
- Use EMB flow diagrams to orient interactions  
- Follow the ECL → PHCS → SAAS → SCC cognitive pipeline  
- Maintain boundary discipline  

This prevents subsystem drift and fragmentation.

---

## 6. EMB Should Be Read Before Technical Deep Work
Before developing or analyzing:
- SAAS orchestration  
- Messaging Fabric  
- PHCS lane logic  
- SCC governance  
- HOMSP integration  
- UCS synthesis  

Reading EMB first stabilizes cognitive posture and prevents drift.

---

## 7. EMB Declares What Is Out of Scope
If something does not appear in EMB:
- It is not part of the ecosystem  
- Or it belongs in EnaC operational tooling (CFP, CIP, VS, DMP, GlossRP, etc.)  
- Or requires review before inclusion  

This prevents ad hoc subsystem creation.

---

## 8. EMB Is Versioned and Evolves Carefully
For any architectural change:
- Update the subsystem spec  
- Then update EMB  
- Maintain a delta or change log  

The EMB evolves only when the architecture evolves.

---

## 9. EMB Is Required for Tier-0 / Tier-1 Bootstrapping
When starting a new AI session for architecture:
- Load EMB first  
- Then load subsystem specs  
- Then load operational EnaC tools  

This ensures the cognitive ontology is stable before any reasoning.

---

## 10. EMB Enables Hybrid Human + AI Co-Reasoning
Humans use EMB to:
- Maintain coherence  
- Understand system shape  
- Anchor cognitive decisions  

AI uses EMB to:
- Maintain architectural consistency  
- Prevent drift  
- Resolve boundary ambiguity  
- Maintain subsystem identity  

EMB is the shared anchor.

---

## Summary
**The EMB is the ecosystem’s master map.  
Use it to orient, constrain, align, and structure all subsequent work.**  
All subsystems, tools, protocols, and diagrams flow from it.
