# STGM Artifact — Transferrable Modeling Mandate  
### Version 1.0

---

## 1. Context

During the active co-development of ECL and MxVA, a critical concern emerged:

> Avoid allowing the work to collapse into an inward, self-referential loop that only refines itself, rather than producing value that can be *transferred* to others.

The user explicitly identified the need for a **mandate** that all modeling work must remain oriented toward real-world applicability and human transfer.

---

## 2. Core Mandate

**Modeling outputs must not be self-contained curiosities.**  
They must:

1. Be **understandable** by others.  
2. Be **usable** by others.  
3. Be **teach-able / coach-able** to others.  
4. Be **testable and adaptable** in other contexts.  

In short:

> **If it cannot be transferred, it is not complete.**

## 3. Risk Identified

Without this mandate, there is a risk that:

- The system becomes **self-referential**, optimizing only for its own internal coherence.  
- The work remains trapped as **personal genius** instead of **shared capability**.  
- The models become harder, not easier, for others to adopt.  

This directly contradicts the intent of ECL and MxVA as frameworks designed for **human collaboration, learning, and augmentation**.

---

## 4. Positive Direction

With the mandate in place:

- Every modeling pass is evaluated by **“Can this be transferred?”**  
- Narrative insights are distilled into **frameworks, templates, and tools**.  
- The output is designed for **others to benefit from**, not just for internal satisfaction.  
- The system stays aligned with the original purpose:  
  - accelerating **human evolution**,  
  - enabling **better collaboration**,  
  - and making **excellence reproducible**.

---

## 5. Operational Cue

A simple guiding question to keep this alive:

> “How will someone else *use* this?”

If that cannot be answered clearly, the modeling work is considered **incomplete** and requires another pass for clarity and transferability.
