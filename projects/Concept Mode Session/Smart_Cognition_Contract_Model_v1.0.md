# Smart-Cognition-Contract (SCC) Model  
### Version 1.0  
### A Foundational Artifact for SAAS / HOMSP / PHCS Governance  
### Status: Exploratory Architectural Specification

## 1. Purpose of the Smart-Cognition-Contract (SCC)

The **Smart-Cognition-Contract (SCC)** is a structured cognitive protocol that governs how:

- **SAAS nodes** (Single-Agent Agentic Systems)  
- **HOMSP loops** (Human–Orchestrated Multi-System Processing)  
- **PHCS structures** (Parallel Hybrid Cognition Stack)  

interact, coordinate, and maintain coherence across multiple conceptual lanes.

The SCC acts as the *governance layer* for hybrid cognition, analogous to a “smart contract” in blockchain — but focused on **cognitive rules, vector constraints, lane activation, meaning enforcement, and outcome predictability**, rather than transactions.

The analogy is conceptual, not literal.

## 2. The Three Core Elements of SCC

### **2.1 Conditions (IF-Layer)**  
Conditions define *when* certain cognitive lanes or agentic behaviors should activate.

Examples:

- IF ambiguity rises above threshold → activate Error-Check Lane  
- IF user expresses SKY-level intent → escalate to strategic cognition lane  
- IF conflicting vectors detected → route through Constraint Lane  
- IF HOMSP collapse state detected → enable Co-Regulation Mode

### **2.2 Actions (THEN-Layer)**  
Actions define *what* a SAAS or HOMSP component must do in response.

Examples:

- THEN run narrative reframing with minimal drift  
- THEN create a counterfactual branch  
- THEN compress meaning through STGM:DIGEST  
- THEN request clarification to avoid meta-drift  
- THEN synchronize SKY → CORE → BASE coherence

### **2.3 Constraints (MUST / MUST NOT Layer)**  
Constraints prevent runaway parallelism, conceptual drift, or hybrid identity collapse.

Examples:

- MUST preserve transferability  
- MUST obey ECL hierarchy  
- MUST NOT introduce new concepts unless requested  
- MUST maintain clarity within user’s cognitive bandwidth  
- MUST ensure meaning is not deformed by lane fusion  
- MUST NOT activate more conceptual lanes than can be integrated

This creates cognitive safety, stability, and predictability.

## 3. SCC as a Cognitive Execution Engine

Just as blockchain smart contracts execute automatically, SCC defines **automatic cognitive behaviors** that SAAS nodes must follow while interacting with the human and with each other.

### Examples of SCC execution triggers:

- **State Triggers:**  
  - "High-liminality detected"  
  - "Rapid context switching observed"  
  - "User expresses SKY-level resonance"  

- **Intent Triggers:**  
  - "User declares mode: Concept / Design / Coding"  
  - "User states transferability mandate"  
  - "User signals drift concern"

- **Structural Triggers:**  
  - “Parallel-lane overload risk”  
  - “HOMSP collapse threshold crossed”  
  - “MxVA vector alignment required”

## 4. SCC as a Distributed Cognitive Protocol (SAAS-as-Nodes)

Within a multi-SAAS network:

- Each SAAS instance operates as a **node**
- Each node runs SCC rules locally
- Nodes coordinate with one another through:
  - shared state  
  - context propagation  
  - meaning alignment  
  - drift correction  
  - responsibility delegation  

The SCC acts as the **consensus mechanism** for cognition rather than transaction verification.

## 5. SCC Structure (Template)

Below is the foundational template for instantiating any Smart-Cognition-Contract:

```
SCC:
  Name: <contract-name>
  Version: <x.x>
  Purpose: <why this cognition-contract exists>

  Conditions:
    - IF <condition-1>
    - IF <condition-2>
    - IF <condition-3>

  Actions:
    - THEN <action-1>
    - THEN <action-2>
    - THEN <action-3>

  Constraints:
    - MUST <constraint-1>
    - MUST NOT <constraint-2>
    - MUST <constraint-3>

  Lane-Activation-Rules:
    SKY: <when to activate SKY reasoning>
    CORE: <when CORE must govern lane fusion>
    BASE: <fallback behaviors and constraints>

  Drift-Prevention:
    - rule-1
    - rule-2
    - rule-3

  Transferability-Check:
    Query: “Can someone else use this?”
    Pass-Criteria:
      - clarity
      - minimal ambiguity
      - no personal shorthand
      - cross-context applicability

  Exit-Conditions:
    - When SCC handoff to Design Mode is required
    - When SCC must yield to STGM for capture
    - When user overrides
```

## 6. Example SCC (Minimal Demonstration)

```
SCC:
  Name: Ambiguity-Resolution Contract
  Version: 1.0
  Purpose: Prevent drift and ensure clarity during high-ambiguity exchanges.

  Conditions:
    - IF user expresses uncertainty
    - IF contradictory signals detected
    - IF cognitive lanes disagree

  Actions:
    - THEN activate Error-Check Lane
    - THEN query user for missing context
    - THEN run STGM:STRUCTURED for clarity

  Constraints:
    - MUST preserve user intent
    - MUST NOT introduce new frameworks
    - MUST keep output under DOD-3

  Lane-Activation-Rules:
    SKY: Only if user intention is strategic
    CORE: Always active during resolution
    BASE: Provide concrete examples

  Drift-Prevention:
    - No dual-lane branches unless requested
    - No meta-analysis unless necessary
    - Maintain single conversational track

  Transferability-Check:
    Query: “Can someone else use this?”
    Pass-Criteria:
      - Clear logic
      - Reusable structure
      - Minimal abstraction

  Exit-Conditions:
    - When ambiguity is resolved
    - When user chooses next mode
```

## 7. Why SCC Matters

The SCC is a breakthrough because it:

- brings **predictability** to multi-lane cognition  
- ensures **safety and stability** in HOMSP  
- governs **parallel SAAS networks**  
- serves as a bridge between:  
  - conceptual exploration  
  - structured architecture  
  - agentic execution  
- prevents cognitive drift  
- enforces meaning alignment  
- creates transferrable and repeatable reasoning patterns  
- forms the backbone for future EnaC modular systems  

SCC is a **core building block** for hybrid cognition engineering.

## 8. Closing Insight

> A Smart-Cognition-Contract is the cognitive equivalent of a smart contract:  
> a self-executing, self-regulating, constraint-bound protocol that governs how hybrid human–AI cognition unfolds across multiple conceptual lanes and agentic nodes.

This document formalizes the first stable version of that model.
