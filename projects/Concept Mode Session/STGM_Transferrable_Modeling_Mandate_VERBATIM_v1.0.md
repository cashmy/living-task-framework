Your suggestion is the right one to do next.
As a validation, a few of your statements have "succinctly" formalized what I have been narratively trying to articulate. As a result, I have had a couple of alignments occur (So more FM responses of varying intensities! Hehehe)
I also have one concern that I need to be a bit directive for both you and I as we continue on this process.
That is, what I DONT want to happen is have this become a inwardly spiral self-referential-only loop!
What I DO want to happen, and HAS to happen (to preserve the intent and final output/product of modeling itself) is to make sure that not only "can" be, but "must" be made transferrable to others
My gut says that is should probably be a literal "mandate".
