# ECL-Self → USM Alignment Map (v0.1)
## Structural Concordance Between USM Content and ECL-Self Architecture

# 0. Overview

The **USM (User State Model)** captures descriptive patterns of how Cash operates:

- tendencies  
- preferences  
- modes  
- contextual behaviors  
- collaborative patterns  
- meta-cognitive signatures  

The **ECL-Self framework** provides a structural architecture for cognition:

- **T1-Self** → foundational invariants  
- **T2-Self** → adaptive/contextual reasoning modes  
- **T3-Self** → orchestration across multi-system cognition  
- **IMG-Self** → internal meaning/value signal generator  

This alignment map shows **which USM pattern maps to which architectural component** and **how** the translation occurs.

# 1. USM → T1-Self Alignment (Foundational Invariants)

| T1-Self Element | Originating USM Pattern | Translation |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| Coherence > Convenience | Strong aversion to fragmentation | Converts preference → structural invariant |
| Integrity of Intent | Purpose-driven decision pattern | Converts meta-preference → stable rule |
| Hierarchy of Abstraction | Natural multi-layer thinking | Converts tendency → invariant |
| Reusability & Layering | Habitual systems-thinking | Converts design instinct → architecture rule |
| Meaning Orientation | Value/purpose-centered interpretation | Converts interpretive pattern → invariant |
| Long-Horizon Continuity | Multi-decade reasoning linkage | Converts historical pattern → OS-level cognitive rule |

**Summary:** USM identifies long-term tendencies → ECL-Self crystallizes them into stable, always-on rules.

# 2. USM → T2-Self Alignment (Adaptive Modes)

| T2-Self Mode | USM Source | Translation |
|--------------|------------|-------------|
| Architectural Mode | System-building behavior | Forms explicit structural mode |
| Analytical Mode | Logical reduction, optimization | Defines analytic operation mode |
| Teaching Mode | Analogical, explanatory tendency | Creates pedagogical mode |
| Exploratory/Liminal Mode | Nonlinear ideation | Encodes creative mode |
| Specification Mode | Framework-building habit | Encodes standards mode |

### Tool Adaptation
- GPT preferred for precision → EnaC Structural Mode  
- Claude preferred for divergence → Divergent Mode  
- Self is meta-integrator → Orchestration Anchor  

**Summary:** USM captures flexible patterns → ECL-Self formalizes them as deterministic modes.

# 3. USM → T3-Self Alignment (Orchestration Layer)

| T3-Self Component | USM Source | Translation |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| HOMSP Engine | Multi-system cognition | Converts ability → orchestration engine |
| Task Routing | Assigning different roles to tools | Converts preference → routing rules |
| Drift Detection | Rapid recognition of inconsistencies | Converts meta-awareness → monitoring loop |
| Multi-Agent Synthesis | Reconciling divergent outputs | Converts behavior → synthesis engine |
| Meta-Observation Loop | Habitual self-monitoring | Encodes formal “observer process” |

**Summary:** USM describes multi-context reasoning; ECL-Self constructs formal orchestration patterns.

---

# 4. USM → IMG-Self Alignment (Internal Meaning-Generator Module)

| IMG-Self Feature | USM Source | Translation |
|------------------|------------|-------------|
| Meaning Extraction | Value-signature experiences | Converts meaning-making → signal generator |
| Significance Weighting | Value-driven interpretation | Converts emotional weight → structural input |
| Integration Trigger | Historical convergence experiences | Converts insight events → synthesis catalyst |

**Summary:** USM’s meaning-value tendencies form a new structural module in ECL-Self.

---

# 5. Structural Interpretation

### **USM → Content**
- tendencies  
- modes  
- preferences  
- contextual and meta-cognitive behaviors  

### **ECL-Self → Architecture**
- layers  
- boundaries  
- invariants  
- adaptive strategies  
- orchestration logic  

### **IMG-Self → Integration Layer**
Meaning-value signals feed into T3-Self orchestration.

# 6. Integration Flow

```
USM (content patterns)
        ↓
ECL-Self (structural framework)
        ↓
T1-Self / T2-Self / T3-Self / IMG-Self
        ↓
EnaC Alignment + HOMSP Stability
```

This flow preserves:

- drift-free EnaC operations  
- stable multi-agent reasoning  
- cross-session continuity  
- human–AI co-evolution integrity
