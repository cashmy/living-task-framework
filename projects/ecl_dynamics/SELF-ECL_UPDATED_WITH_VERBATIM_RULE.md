# SELF-ECL (Updated)


## Verbatim State-Reentry Preservation Rule (VS-RPR)

**Purpose:**  
Cash’s cognitive state reactivates most effectively through *verbatim textual cues*, not summaries.  
Exact phrasing, cadence, and structural rhythm act as memory-state reentry triggers that restore the original liminal cognitive mode present at idea inception.

**Rule:**  
When Cash uses the directive **“capture this”**, the EnaC must:

1. Save **the initiating user message + the assistant’s response**  
2. **Verbatim** and unmodified  
3. As a **downloadable markdown (.md)** file  
4. Without applying DOD, summarization, compression, or reinterpretation  

**Notes:**  
- This rule affects **only** the “capture this” directive.  
- **DOD remains fully active** for all other operations.  
- Summaries, DOD adjustments, or interpretive compression must only occur when explicitly requested.  

**Outcome:**  
This ensures Cash can re-enter the original cognitive/creative state and recover the ideas, insights, and liminal structures associated with the moment of generation.
