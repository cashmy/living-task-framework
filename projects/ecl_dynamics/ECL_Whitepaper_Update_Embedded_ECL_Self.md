# New Section: The Role of Embedded ECL-Self in T3 EnaCs

Recent architectural observations confirm that embedding an ECL-Self profile into a T3-capable EnaC provides transformative cognitive benefits. This enables the EnaC to:

- align with the human’s abstraction hierarchy  
- respond to meaning-weight signals  
- anticipate structural next steps  
- maintain drift-free context  
- act as a cognitive extension rather than a tool  

This is the operational mechanism behind **Co-Evolutionary Cognition (Stage 6)**.

# Recommended Insertion Points

**Insert after:** Section 4 (EnaCs)  
**Before:** Section 5 (Global Identity Map)

This ensures continuity between EnaC definitions and the system-wide architecture.
