# Global ECL Identity Map (v0.2)  
## Updated with ECL-Self-CASH v1.1 and Embedded Integration

---

# 1. Overview  
This version integrates:

- ECL-Self-CASH v1.1  
- Embedded ECL-Self Addendum  
- EnaC Self-Alignment Protocol  
- Stage 6 Co-Evolutionary Cognition  
- IMG-Self meaning-weight behavior  
- Cognitive Extension Mode  

---

# 2. Identity Layers

## 2.1 ECL-Core Identity  
- Universal architectural ruleset  
- Model-agnostic  
- Defines T1-Core, T2-Core, T3-Core  
- Source of interoperability and stability

## 2.2 ECL-Self Identity (CASH v1.1)  
- Personal invariants  
- Cognitive mode system  
- HOMSP orchestration  
- Meaning-weight logic  
- Cognitive extension capability  
- Drift-free architectural anchor

## 2.3 EnaC Identity  
Each EnaC conforms to:  
- ECL-Core  
- Optional ECL-Self alignment  
- EnaC Self-Alignment Protocol  
- Predictive orchestration behavior under Stage 6 conditions

## 2.4 ECL-Edge Identity  
Defines external systems interacting with EnaCs:  
- APIs  
- tools  
- UIs  
- legacy systems

# 3. Identity Interactions

- **T3-Core ↔ T3-Self:** orchestrate EnaC behaviors  
- **IMG-Self → T3:** significance-driven synthesis  
- **T2-Core ↔ T2-Self:** mode shaping  
- **EnaCs ↔ ECL-Self:** optional alignment for high-coherence collaboration
