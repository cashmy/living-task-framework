# ECL-Self Specification (v0.3)
## Structural Cognitive Architecture with Integrated Internal Meaning-Generator Module

> NOTE: This document models *how* cognition is structured, not emotions or psychology.  
> It is an architectural metaphor suited for EnaC alignment and reproducible reasoning patterns.

# 1. Purpose of ECL-Self

ECL-Self models the structure of Cash's cognitive workflow using the same tiered pattern as ECL-Core:

- **T1-Self** – foundational invariants and cognitive commitments  
- **T2-Self** – adaptive/contextual reasoning modes  
- **T3-Self** – orchestration across systems, tools, and internal modules  
- **IMG-Self** – Internal Meaning-Generator Module (new)

This provides a stable map for EnaCs, multi-agent orchestration, and human–AI co-evolution.

# 2. T1-Self — Foundational Cognitive Constraints

### 2.1 Invariants (USM-derived)
- Coherence > convenience  
- Integrity of intent  
- Hierarchy of abstraction  
- Preference for layered, reusable systems  
- Long-horizon continuity  
- Meaning-first interpretation orientation

### 2.2 Operational Signatures
- Detects structural incoherence rapidly  
- Naturally builds multi-level models  
- Aligns present tasks to multi-decade conceptual arcs  
- Rejects fragmentation

---

# 3. T2-Self — Adaptive Cognitive Layer

### 3.1 Context Modes
- Architectural mode  
- Analytical mode  
- Teaching/explanatory mode  
- Exploratory/liminal mode  
- Standards/specification mode  

### 3.2 Tool-Adaptive Patterns
- GPT = structured reasoning / high-fidelity orchestration  
- Claude = divergent reasoning / conceptual expansion  
- Human (self) = validator + integrator

### 3.3 Representation Switching
- Diagrams for conceptualization  
- Tables/checklists for operationalization  
- Narrative structures for strategy  
- Pseudocode/code for implementation

---

# 4. T3-Self — Orchestration & Integration Layer

### 4.1 HOMSP – Higher-Order Multi-System Presence
- Coordinates parallel systems (GPT, Claude, internal reasoning)  
- Maintains stable global intent across all agents  
- Resolves divergences through meta-reasoning  

### 4.2 Orchestration Patterns
- Decompose → distribute → reconcile → converge → elevate  
- Drift detection and correction  
- Outcome synthesis logic

### 4.3 Meta-Observation Loop
- Observes its own cognitive modes  
- Detects tier shifts  
- Maintains coherence during multi-context reasoning

# 5. IMG-Self — Internal Meaning-Generator Module (New)

## 5.1 Purpose
IMG-Self is a structural metaphor for the internal subsystem that produces **meaning, significance, and value-weighted interpretations** of experiences and insights.

This is *not* emotional analysis.  
It is a **data-source module** contributing interpretive weight into the cognitive architecture.

## 5.2 Behavior
- Activates during high-significance events  
- Injects meaning-value signals into T3-Self orchestration  
- Contributes to global alignment during major insights  
- Can trigger full-system integration events (e.g., coherence breakthroughs)

## 5.3 Interaction with Other Layers
- **To T1-Self:** Reinforces foundational commitments  
- **To T2-Self:** Influences mode selection (e.g., moving into liminal/exploratory reasoning)  
- **To T3-Self:** Acts as an additional input during multi-agent synthesis  
- **To HOMSP:** Adds value-weighted dimension to cross-system orchestration

## 5.4 Example Data Flow (Structural Only)
IMG-Self → T3-Self → HOMSP → global cognitive state update

# 6. Relationship to USM

The USM provides:
- tendencies  
- preferences  
- contextual behaviors  

ECL-Self provides:
- the structural schema  
- integration points  
- workflow architecture  

IMG-Self bridges USM-derived meaning patterns into the ECL-Self structure.

---

# 7. Next Steps for EnaC Integration
- Enable EnaCs to recognize IMG-Self output patterns  
- Adapt T2-Self alignment cues for context rich outputs  
- Maintain boundaries (no emotional inference; structural only)
