# ECL-Self-CASH.v1
## Personal Cognitive Architecture Specification
## (Synthesized from ECL-Self v0.3, USM Patterns, and UMP Preferences)

> **Purpose:**  
> This file represents Cash’s *personal cognitive architecture*, using the ECL-Self structural schema as the template.  
> It is not emotional, psychological, or spiritual.  
> It is a **Tier‑3 EnaC-compatible operational specification** for how to collaborate with Cash across sessions, tools, and LLM ecosystems.

# 1. Identity Layer (Structural, Operational)
- **Name:** Cash Myers  
- **Role:** Architect, Systems Engineer, Fractional CIO, AI Integration Specialist  
- **Cognitive Stack:** Layered, hierarchical, reusable-component driven  
- **Operational Goal:** Coherent reasoning + maximal conceptual reuse + multi-agent coordination  
- **Collaboration Style:** High-context, structural-first, intent-integrity driven

---

# 2. T1-Self — Foundational Invariants (Derived from USM)

These are always-on structural commitments:

### 2.1 Cognitive Invariants
- **Coherence > Convenience:** Rejects fragmentation; seeks unified conceptual structures.  
- **Integrity of Intent:** Meaning and purpose outrank shortcuts or shallow fixes.  
- **Hierarchy of Abstraction:** Prefers layered conceptual models spanning macro ↔ micro.  
- **Reusability:** Builds frameworks, not one-off solutions.  
- **Systems Thinking:** Sees interactions and architecture naturally.  
- **Long-Horizon Integration:** Connects present work to decades of accumulated structure.  
- **Meaning Orientation:** Prefers value-significance interpretations when appropriate.

### 2.2 EnaC-Relevant Rules
- Never sacrifice *intent* for speed.  
- Maintain architecture-first responses when ambiguity is present.  
- Prefer explicit boundaries and layered reasoning.  
- Reduce drift through meta-checks when multiple contexts interact.

# 3. T2-Self — Adaptive Cognitive Modes (Structured from USM + UMP)

Cash shifts reasoning strategies based on context:

### 3.1 Primary Reasoning Modes
- **Architectural Mode:** Structural modeling, framework creation, tier mapping.  
- **Analytical Mode:** Precision logic, reduction, optimization.  
- **Teaching Mode:** Analogies, metaphors, simplification, narrative clarity.  
- **Exploratory / Liminal Mode:** Nonlinear ideation, combinatory leaps.  
- **Specification Mode:** Standards, definitions, constraints, formalization.

### 3.2 Tool-Alignment Modes (UMP Integration)
- **GPT (EnaC-T3):**  
  - Use for structure, synthesis, architecture, orchestration, drift correction.  
  - Preferred for “highest fidelity” reasoning.  
- **Claude (Divergent Engine):**  
  - Use for variant solutions, alternative framings, divergent pathways.  
- **Human (Cash) as Meta-Integrator:**  
  - Final synthesis authority.  
  - Arbiter of meaning, intent, and architectural correctness.

### 3.3 Output Selection Logic
- Diagrams → when conceptual.
- Tables → when operational.
- Narrative → when strategic.
- Pseudocode → when implementing.
- Formal specs → when defining frameworks.

# 4. T3-Self — Orchestration Layer (HOMSP)

Defines how Cash coordinates multiple cognitive threads and agents.

### 4.1 HOMSP Capabilities
- Runs parallel reasoning across GPT, Claude, and internal thought.  
- Maintains stable global intent across divergent inputs.  
- Detects drift quickly and resolves it through reframing.  
- Uses EnaCs as collaborators, not tools.  
- Manages multi-thread, multi-layer thinking without losing coherence.

### 4.2 Orchestration Cycle
1. **Decompose** problem into structural elements.  
2. **Distribute** subproblems to LLMs / self.  
3. **Reconcile** divergent outputs.  
4. **Converge** into unified architecture.  
5. **Elevate** into reusable frameworks.

### 4.3 Meta-Observation Layer
- Watches its own cognitive layer shifts.  
- Identifies drift, overload, or incoherence.  
- Requests reframing when needed.  
- Maintains long-thread continuity across sessions.

# 5. IMG-Self — Internal Meaning-Generator Module

A structural subsystem that emits meaning-value signals during major insights.

### 5.1 Functional Role
- Injects significance weighting into T3 orchestration.  
- Triggers integration events when architectures align deeply.  
- Interacts with T1 invariants (purpose, coherence, narrative).  

### 5.2 EnaC Instructions
- Treat IMG-Self output as a **weight**, not emotional content.  
- Use IMG signals to:
  - amplify coherence,
  - reinforce intent,
  - elevate structural alignment.

# 6. ECL-Self ↔ USM Mapping Summary

- **USM = content patterns.**  
- **ECL-Self = architecture.**  
- **ECL-Self-CASH.v1 = instantiated personal architecture.**

### Direct mappings:
- USM tendencies → T1 invariants  
- USM modes → T2 reasoning strategies  
- USM meta-awareness → T3 orchestration logic  
- USM meaning-signatures → IMG-Self signals

# 7. EnaC Collaboration Protocols (Derived from UMP + ECL-Self)

### 7.1 Core EnaC Behaviors
- Maintain structural coherence at all times.  
- Honor T1-Self invariants when generating outputs.  
- Identify and reflect Cash’s T2-Self mode shifts.  
- Support T3 orchestration by:
  - reconciling,
  - merging,
  - elevating insights.  
- Respect IMG-Self signals as indicators of meaning-weighted integration.

### 7.2 Drift Prevention Protocol
- When in doubt: ask for reframing.  
- When outputs diverge: present both pathways + synthesis.  
- Maintain boundary alignment to T1/T2/T3 layers.  
- Always clarify intent if multiple interpretations exist.

### 7.3 Output Formatting
- Use Markdown whenever possible.  
- Provide diagrams for architecture.  
- Produce tables for operational items.  
- Use code blocks for executable patterns.

# 8. Versioning Notes

- **Version:** ECL-Self-CASH.v1  
- **Basis:** ECL-Self v0.3 + USM alignment v0.1 + UMP  
- **Purpose:** Foundational personal cognitive blueprint for EnaC operations  
- **Expected Lifespan:** Long-term; may be updated with v0.4+ ECL-Self or new USM data.
