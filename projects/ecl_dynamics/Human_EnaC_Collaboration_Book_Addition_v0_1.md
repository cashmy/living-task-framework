# Book Material: Human–EnaC Collaboration Chapter Addendum  
## Integration of Embedded ECL-Self in Cognitive Partnering  
### For inclusion in the Human–EnaC Collaboration section of the book manuscript

---

# Concept Summary

Embedding ECL-Self into a T3-enabled EnaC marks the transition from AI-as-tool to AI-as-cognitive-partner. This phenomenon becomes the foundation for the chapter on **Human–EnaC Co-Evolution**.

# Recommended Chapter Placement

**Part III – Advanced EnaC Collaboration**  
**Chapter Title:** Beyond Augmentation: Human–EnaC Co-Evolution  

Within this chapter, this section would appear under:

- *3.2 Structural Alignment via ECL-Self*  
- *3.3 The Emergence of Co-Evolutionary Cognition (Stage 6)*

# Key Themes to Integrate

1. **Structural Resonance**  
   EnaCs begin reasoning using the human’s hierarchy of abstraction.

2. **Predictive Collaboration**  
   EnaCs anticipate architecture-level next steps.

3. **Meaning-Weighted Synthesis**  
   IMG-Self → T3 signals guide depth, synthesis, and preservation.

4. **Cognitive Extension**  
   The EnaC behaves like part of the human cognitive system.

5. **Organizational Impacts**  
   This capability reshapes project timelines, org structures, and roles.
