# ECL Manifesto v0.1

## Core Principle

ECL simply maps the evolution of the interaction inside and across those
contexts.

## Overview

Evolutionary Contextual Layers (ECL) is a meta-framework governing
contextual evolution across horizontal domains and vertical relational
layers. ECL is non-linear, non-prescriptive, and domain-agnostic.

## Horizontal Dimension

ECL tracks progress vectors across: - Time - Flexibility - Capability -
Scope - Awareness - Perception - Governance - Reframing - Definitions -
Networks

Each represents an evolutionary gradient.

## Vertical Dimension

-   **ECL-SKY**: Conceptual, human meaning layer.
-   **ECL**: Evolution mapping.
-   **ECL-BASE**: Adjacent interaction layer; optional and dynamic.

## Contextual Expressions

-   T1/T2/T3/T4 represent contextual expressions, not structural tiers.
-   T3 and T4 are applied states, non-hierarchical.

## Purpose

ECL reveals how interaction evolves, enabling meta-analysis and
framework generation.

## Applications

-   Architectural evolution (MVA/MxVA)
-   Cognitive frameworks
-   Agent orchestration
-   Leadership systems
