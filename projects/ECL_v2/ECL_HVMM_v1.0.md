# ECL-HVMM v1.0

**Horizontal--Vertical Movement Model (Official ECL Addendum)**

## Purpose

ECL-HVMM describes how cognitive, architectural, and implementation
activity moves vertically (SKY ↔ CORE ↔ BASE) and horizontally (T3 ↔ T2
↔ T1 ↔ T0.5) during real evolutionary execution.

## 1. Vertical Movement (ECL-V)

-   **ECL-SKY**: Purpose / meaning / relational context\
-   **ECL-CORE**: Evolution engine / mapping / reframing\
-   **ECL-BASE**: Implementation substrate

Vertical motion is used for reframing purpose, evolving architecture,
interpreting implementation feedback, aligning cognition with intent,
and updating constraints.

## 2. Horizontal Movement (ECL-H)

Operational tier shifts: - **T3**: Meta-architecture, EnaC co-evolution\
- **T2**: Architectural structuring\
- **T1**: Task-level implementation planning\
- **T0.5**: Utilities and raw operational tasks

## 3. Combined HVMM (Full ECL Motion)

ECL-H and ECL-V operate together, enabling: - continuous vertical
alignment\
- horizontal decomposition\
- bidirectional corrections\
- recursive evolution

## 4. HVMM Principle

**ECL supports continuous bi-directional evolution across both abstract
meaning and concrete implementation by allowing movement along both
vertical and horizontal vectors.**
