# MxVA Project Initiation Guide v1.0

## 1. Purpose
This guide enables ANY person—technical or non-technical—to initiate a full MxVA software project using natural human thinking patterns.

## 2. Step 1 — Describe the Big Picture Narrative
Explain:
- What is happening?
- What hurts?
- What is the friction?
- What do you wish was different?

Write this like a story, not a specification.

## 3. Step 2 — Explain the Desired Outcomes
Finish these statements:
- “I want this system to help me…”
- “I want to stop losing…”
- “I want to feel…”
- “I want to avoid…”

This triggers ECL‑SKY alignment.

## 4. Step 3 — Must-Haves vs Nice-to-Haves
List:
### Must-Haves
Requirements without which the project fails.

### Nice-to-Haves
Capabilities that enhance but are not mandatory initially.

MxVA will later achieve ALL of these.

## 5. Step 4 — Describe Possible Uses
Explain how you think you may use it:
- Daily?
- Periodically?
- For creativity?
- For automation?
- For planning?

This helps EnaC models form T3 projections.

## 6. Step 5 — Describe Where It Fits in Your World
Where will it live?
- On your computer?
- Cloud?
- Phone?
- Tablet?
- Integrated with other systems?

MxVA uses this to form architectural constraints.

## 7. Step 6 — Identify Data Inputs
List natural input types:
- Audio
- Text
- Files
- Images
- Notes

Do this informally.

## 8. Step 7 — Identify the “Magic Moment”
Describe the moment you say:
“YES—that’s exactly what I needed.”

This defines your architectural quality threshold.

## 9. Step 8 — Describe What You Want the System to DO
Not in technical terms. In human terms:
- “Organize my thoughts”
- “Give me clarity”
- “Summarize long content”
- “Tell me the next step”
- “Help me build something”

MxVA will translate this into:
- pipelines  
- subsystems  
- interfaces  
- milestones  

## 10. Step 9 — Describe Future Expansion
Explain:
- “Later, I might also want…”
- “Eventually, this could be used for…”

This allows MxVA to avoid architectural traps.

## 11. Step 10 — Let MxVA Build the Architecture
Once steps 1–9 are documented, the EnaC system will produce:
- Architecture  
- Milestones  
- Specs  
- C2CB packets  
- Tests  
- Code  

You simply guide the vision.

## 12. Conclusion
MxVA enables ANYONE to build complex systems using natural cognition. This guide is the “front door” for all future EnaC projects.
