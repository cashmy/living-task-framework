# ECL Bidirectional Evolution Corollary v0.1

**Addendum to the ECL Manifesto**

## Statement

**ECL supports and requires bidirectional movement across both vertical
(SKY--CORE--BASE) and horizontal (T3--T2--T1--T0.5) axes during applied
execution.**

## Reason

Evolution is not linear; systems, humans, and architectures evolve
through continuous feedback loops.

## Implications

### Vertical Movement

-   Meaning → Evolution → Implementation\
-   Implementation → Feedback → Evolution → Meaning

### Horizontal Movement

-   T3 → T2 → T1 → T0.5\
-   Operational realities → T3 reinterpretation

### Dynamic Traversal

-   Movement is multidirectional\
-   Architecture stays stable because meaning is stable\
-   Implementation stays flexible because boundaries are meaningful

### Cognitive Implication

-   EnaCs must traverse both axes\
-   Coding LLMs operate mainly T2/T1\
-   Conceptual LLMs operate mostly T3\
-   Humans traverse all simultaneously

## Summary

**ECL is not a hierarchy. It is a multidirectional evolutionary field
enabling coherent evolution across meaning, architecture, and
implementation.**
