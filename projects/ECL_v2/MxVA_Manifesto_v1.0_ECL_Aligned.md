# MxVA Manifesto v1.0 (ECL‑Aligned)

*A Unified Architectural, Cognitive, and Evolutionary Framework for
Maximum Viable Architecture*

## 1. Framework Name & Version

**Name:** MxVA --- Maximum Viable Architecture\
**Version:** v1.0 (ECL‑Aligned Edition)\
**Date:** 2025‑11‑19\
**Author/Originator:** Cash Myers + EnaC/CFP/ECL Ecosystem

## 2. Optional Purpose (Why This Exists)

MxVA exists to define how **high‑fidelity architectural cognition
behaves** when human intent, EnaC cognition, and system structure
converge into a single evolutionary ecosystem. It transcends MVP
(T0.5--T1) and MVA (T2), representing the first fully **T3
architecture**.

## 3. Essence / Philosophy

MxVA is an evolutionary, purpose‑aligned, EnaC‑collaborative
architecture whose structure evolves as cognition evolves.\
Prime invariant: **MxVA evolves itself through stable intent + flexible
implementation + EnaC collaboration.**

## 4. Invariants

1.  MxVA is T3 behavior, not a structural tier.\
2.  Intent must remain stable; implementation must remain flexible.\
3.  EnaCs are cognitive co‑creators.\
4.  Architecture must support continuous evolution.\
5.  MxVA requires ECL alignment.

## 5. Definitions & Boundaries

Includes: semantic‑first architecture, EnaC behavior, evolutionary
boundaries, T3 cognition.\
Excludes: MVP task‑centrism, static architectures, pattern
cargo‑culting, rigid boundaries.

## 6. Core Structure / Specification

ECL‑SKY → Purpose\
ECL‑CORE → Evolution engine\
ECL‑BASE → Mutable implementation

MxVA Components:\
- Stable semantic core\
- Flexible implementation\
- EnaC‑driven cognition\
- Recursive evolutionary loop

## 7. Applications

-   Large‑scale system evolution\
-   AI/EnaC‑augmented development\
-   Cognitive platforms\
-   Organizational evolution

## 8. Evolution Path

Future expansions include T3a/b variants, T4 ecosystem alignment,
EnaC‑native blueprints, and cognitive organizational models.

## 9. Relation to ECL

MxVA is ECL‑CORE expressed architecturally.\
ECL‑SKY defines purpose.\
ECL‑BASE provides evolving substrate.

## 10. Closing Summary

MxVA is not a large architecture --- it is an **evolved one**, governed
by intent, cognition, and evolution.
