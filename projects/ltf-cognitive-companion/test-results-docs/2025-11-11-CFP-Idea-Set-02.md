## 🧩 Captured Idea Anchors (Set 02)

### Idea 3 — Meta-Documentation of Interactive Capture Mode
**Summary:**  
Document the live *“capture mode engaged”* functionality itself. Though not part of the original CFP design scope, its emergent behavior provides real-time reflection of cognitive state and intellectual process.

**Purpose:**  
- Capture the evolution of thought and flow-state transitions.  
- Serve as an “active journaling” layer for creative reasoning.  
- Offer users transparent insight into the system’s operational mode.

**Tags:** `MetaProcess`, `Reflection`, `FlowState`

### Idea 4 — Multi-Format Output Options (CFP Tier 2)
**Summary:**  
Add tiered output capabilities so that CFP can export captures in various file formats (.md, .docx, .txt, .pdf, etc.) depending on AI environment permissions and user preference.

**Purpose:**  
- Increase interoperability with external tools and publishing systems.  
- Facilitate automated reporting and versioning.

**Tags:** `OutputFormats`, `Tier2`, `Integration`

### Idea 5 — Monetization Strategy for CFP Tiers 2 and 3
**Summary:**  
Initiate exploration into monetization models for advanced CFP tiers.

**Conceptual Avenues:**  
- Subscription or license for professional use.  
- Tiered feature unlocks (automation, API integration, analytics).  
- Certification or ethical-collaboration compliance badges.

**Tags:** `BusinessModel`, `Monetization`, `Strategy`

### Idea 6 — Temporal Data Insight via Timestamped Captures
**Summary:**  
Observation that timestamped file-naming conventions (`YYYY-MM-DD-Topic`) are generating measurable insights into time allocation and productivity.

**Purpose:**  
- Enable accurate temporal analytics across SDLC phases.  
- Provide baseline data for evaluating productivity improvements through AI integration.

**Tags:** `Analytics`, `Productivity`, `TimeTracking`

### Idea 7 — Project-Specific CIP-E Uploadable Context Files
**Summary:**  
Develop *CIP-E context packages* (uploadable files) containing project- or domain-specific cognitive configurations.

**Use Cases:**  
- Detailed contextual uploads for multi-chapter books, milestone maps, or technical projects.  
- Alternative to LTF *Snapshot + Resume* feature for users without access to full framework.

**Tags:** `CIP-E`, `Context`, `Integration`, `Accessibility`
