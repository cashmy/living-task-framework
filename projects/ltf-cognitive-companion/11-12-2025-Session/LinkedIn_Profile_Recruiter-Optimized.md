# LinkedIn “About” — Recruiter-Optimized Version (Open to Opportunities)

I am a systems architect, fractional CIO/CTO, and senior software engineer specializing in AI integration, enterprise architecture, and multi-stack product development. I help organizations modernize systems, reduce operational complexity, and accelerate delivery by combining deep technical expertise with AI-augmented workflows.

My core strength is systemic thinking: understanding how technology, people, workflows, and strategy operate as an interconnected whole. I don’t just solve technical problems; I design architectures and processes that scale, adapt, and reduce long-term cost.

What I Do

- Architect large-scale systems across cloud, API ecosystems, healthcare (HL7/FHIR), blockchain, and multi-stack applications
- Integrate AI into engineering workflows to achieve 10×–100× productivity gains
- Lead modernization initiatives for legacy platforms, monolith-to-service transitions, and cost-optimized cloud architectures
- Provide fractional CTO/CIO guidance for companies needing strategic technical leadership
- Develop AI-augmented frameworks that improve documentation, product design, and collaborative engineering

What I Bring

- 20+ years in software engineering and systems architecture
- Expertise spanning Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Node, Django, cloud platforms, CI/CD, and data engineering
- Proven success reducing operational cost while increasing product reliability
- Strong ability to synthesize technical and business requirements into actionable, scalable designs
- Leadership experience guiding teams through AI adoption, architecture transitions, and complex product lifecycles

Recent Work

I’ve been architecting the Cognitive Foundations Platform (CFP)—a system for structuring human–AI collaboration. It helps teams maintain context, improve decision-making, and move from simple “AI usage” to AI-native engineering and leadership workflows.

What I’m Looking For

I'm open to roles such as:

- Senior/Principal Systems Architect
- Senior/Principal Software Engineer
- Director of Engineering / Head of Engineering
- CTO / Fractional CTO
- AI Integration Architect
- Technical Leadership roles in organizations building complex products or modernizing legacy systems

I’m seeking opportunities where I can:

- Lead architecture and modernization efforts
- Mentor technical teams
- Integrate AI responsibly into development and business processes
- Design systems that improve clarity, performance, and long-term sustainability

If your organization is exploring modernization, scaling, or AI-powered transformation, I’d welcome a conversation.
