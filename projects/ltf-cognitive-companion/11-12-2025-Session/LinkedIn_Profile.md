# LinkedIn “About” — Draft 1 (Executive + Human + Technical)

_(balanced for CTOs, CIOs, founders, academic leaders, and AI peers)_

I am a systems architect, fractional CIO/CTO, and AI-integration specialist who builds end-to-end **cognitive ecosystems**, not just software.

My work sits at the intersection of architecture, cognition, and collaboration. I help organizations and development teams move beyond “using AI tools” and into **AI-native thinking**—a mode where context compounds, workflows evolve, and human creativity operates with amplified clarity.

Over the last several years, I’ve designed and led complex projects across healthcare (EHR, HL7/FHIR), enterprise automation, multi-stack engineering, leadership operations, and AI-augmented product development. My focus is always the same:

**Build systems where human intent, organizational context, and AI capability reinforce each other instead of resetting every day.**

This means:

- designing architectures that scale in both complexity and comprehension
- creating reproducible cognitive workflows for teams
- developing AI-assisted systems that actually preserve human context
- coaching leaders on adopting AI without losing strategic vision
- helping developers work at 10×–100× output without sacrificing clarity

I think systemically: whole-systems first, individual features second.
Patterns, workflows, and governance matter just as much as code.

I also think meta-cognitively: I analyze how teams think, how collaboration breaks, and how information decays—then architect structures that prevent that decay from happening.

My most recent work includes developing the Cognitive Foundations Platform (CFP): a framework for human–AI collaboration that preserves context, governs narrative boundaries, and enables multi-session cognitive continuity. CFP is already being used to accelerate writing, architectural design, leadership development, and large-scale product ideation.

Whether I’m consulting with an enterprise team, leading a distributed engineering effort, or coaching an organization on AI adoption, my goal is simple:

> Help humans think better, build faster, and create at the edge of their potential—while keeping the human firmly at the center of the process.

If your organization is exploring AI integration, modernizing architecture, or building systems that require deep thinking and responsible innovation, I’d be glad to talk.
