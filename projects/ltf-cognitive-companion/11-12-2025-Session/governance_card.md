# CFP Governance Card — NISCL Overview

**Purpose:** Quick-reference card for NISCL and the governance mesh across CFP tiers.

---

## Visual Model

Refer to the architectural diagram:

- `NISCL_arch_diagram.png`

Key relationships:

- NISCL is a cross-cutting governance layer.
- It influences Tier 1 (Foundational), Tier 2 (Workflow & Context), and Tier 3 (Creative & Narrative).
- Different subcomponents of NISCL (safety, intent clarification, human primacy, overrides) emphasize different tiers.

---

## Core Reminders

- Human primacy always.
- NISCL ON by default.
- Override modes are explicit and persistent until disabled.
- Editor vs Rewrite vs Structure-Lock vs Capture are distinct operational modes.
