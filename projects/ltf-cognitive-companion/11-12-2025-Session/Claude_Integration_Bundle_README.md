# Claude Integration Bundle (Sonnet 4.5)
This bundle prepares Claude Sonnet 4.5 to operate inside the Cognitive Foundations Platform (CFP), Governance Kernel, NISCL layer, and updated User State Model (USM). It ensures proper ingestion order, mode compatibility, narrative safety, and structural alignment.

## Files in This Bundle
- Claude_Bootstrap_Prompt.md
- Claude_Load_Order.md
- Claude_Full_Ingestion_Sequence.md
- Claude_Mode_Compatibility.md

## Purpose
Equip Claude to:
- Respect CFP governance.
- Honor narrative boundaries and human primacy.
- Apply USM correctly.
- Maintain cross-document dependencies.
- Avoid reframing CFP concepts into Claude’s preferred abstractions.

## How to Use
1. Upload all core CFP files in the order specified.
2. Paste the Claude_Bootstrap_Prompt into Claude.
3. Allow Claude to summarize understanding.
4. Begin integration work or analysis.
