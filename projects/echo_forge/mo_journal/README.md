# EchoForge MO Journal

The MO (Meta Observation) journal keeps reflective entries, instrumentation metadata, and templates in one home so every EchoForge surface honors the same collaboration contract.

> See `mo_journal_design.md` for the living design notes. This README focuses on day-to-day usage.

## Folder Map
| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `entries/` | Authoritative journal entries promoted from drafts (global numbering `moj-XXXX`). |
| `drafts/` | Scratch space for in-progress reflections. Move files to `entries/` once finalized. |
| `../templates/mo_journal/` | Starter layouts. Duplicate into `drafts/` or `entries/` when capturing a new journal. |
| `../config/` | Centralized configs (privacy, retention, instrumentation, future features). Copy the `*.example.yaml` files and customize locally. |
| `system/` | EnaC-written metadata logs (JSONL). No transcripts stored here unless privacy mode explicitly allows it. |

## Quick Start
1. Copy `../templates/mo_journal/reflective.md` into `drafts/moj-XXXX-Code-slug.md` (example: `moj-0123-FutFeat-tier3-enhancements.md`).
2. Update the heading to `# MO Journal Entry #moj-XXXX [Code]: ...` and pick a short code (FutFeat, Insight, Meta, Diag, Share, etc.).
3. Fill in the Observation → Context → AI Reflection → Insight → Action Items sections.
4. Set the `Privacy Mode` field according to `../config/mo_journal_prefs.yaml` (or your local override).
5. When ready, move the file into `entries/`, increment the global `moj-XXXX` counter, and commit with the entry ID in the message.

## Configuring Privacy & Instrumentation
1. Duplicate `../config/mo_journal_prefs.example.yaml` → `../config/mo_journal_prefs.yaml`.
2. Duplicate `../config/mo_journal_instrumentation.example.yaml` → `../config/mo_journal_instrumentation.yaml`.
3. Update values to reflect your preferences (content inclusion, retention, log levels, etc.).
4. Future EnaCs (watcher, synthesis, mobile) will read these files before logging anything.

## System Logs
- `system/watcher_events.jsonl` stores metadata-only events (timestamp, capability, status).
- Use the instrumentation config to control verbosity/rotation when debugging.
- Do not edit this file manually; treat it as append-only.

### Turning watcher logs into entries
1. Run the watcher (see `projects/echo_forge/watcher/README.md`) so it emits an event into `system/watcher_events.jsonl`.
2. Capture the latest event and note its `event_id`, `created_at`, capability, and any summary snippet. PowerShell one-liner:
	```pwsh
	Get-Content projects/echo_forge/mo_journal/system/watcher_events.jsonl -Tail 1 | ConvertFrom-Json
	```
3. Duplicate `../templates/mo_journal/reflective.md` into `drafts/moj-XXXX-Code-slug.md` and reference the event inside the Observation section (e.g., `Watcher Event: wev-123456789abc`).
4. Describe the interpretation, any privacy adjustments, and the resulting action items. If you include transcript excerpts, ensure the privacy mode in the entry matches what was emitted.
5. Promote the finished entry into `entries/` and commit both the Markdown and the updated JSONL log so the traceability link is preserved.

> **Shortcut**: Run `python projects/echo_forge/mo_journal/tools/seed_from_watcher.py` to auto-create a draft seeded with the latest watcher event. Override the title, code, privacy flags, and context metadata with CLI arguments (`--title`, `--code`, `--privacy-mode`, `--context-preset`, `--session-context`, `--energy-tone`, `--action-template`).
> - Context presets (`watcher-relocation`, `automation-scouting`, `futfeat-design`) swap both the Session Context and Energy/Tone lines in one flag.
> - `--session-context` and `--energy-tone` let you set custom phrases if the presets do not fit the run.

### Entry numbering authority
- Use the next available integer in `moj-XXXX` when creating drafts (start at `0001` and zero-pad to four digits).
- Before promoting an entry, confirm no new numbers were added by other EnaCs; if collisions occur, increment and rename before committing.
- Record numbering decisions in commit messages or PR descriptions when multiple entries move in a single change.

## Collaboration Notes
- EnaCs append comments instead of overwriting human text.
- Sharing workflows (Trello/Jira/GitHub/email) will be layered on after summaries/tasks exist; for now, capture intent in each entry’s "Share Intent" section.
- When adding new templates or configs, update this README and `mo_journal_design.md` to keep the contract explicit.
